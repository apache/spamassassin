Release Notes -- Apache SpamAssassin -- Version 3.4.5

Introduction
------------

Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.5 is primarily a security release. 

In this release, there are bug fixes for one CVE.

*** On March 1, 2020, we stopped publishing rulesets with SHA-1 signatures.
    If you do not update to 3.4.2 or later, you will be stuck at the last
    ruleset with SHA-1 signatures. Such an upgrade should be to 3.4.5 to
    obtain the contained security fixes ***

*** Ongoing development on the 3.4 branch has ceased. All future releases
    and bug fixes will be on the 4.0 series, unless a new security issue
    is found that necessitates a 3.4.6 release. ***

Many thanks to the committers, contributors, rule testers, mass checkers,
and code testers who have made this release possible.

Note that the *-rules-*.tgz files are only necessary if you cannot,
or do not wish to, run "sa-update" after install to download the latest
fresh rules.

See the INSTALL and UPGRADE files in the distribution for important
installation notes.


GPG Verification Procedure
--------------------------
The release files also have a .asc accompanying them.  The file serves
as an external GPG signature for the given release file.  The signing
key is available via the keys.gnupg.net or keys.openpgp.org key servers,
as well as https://www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin/KEYS



The following key is used to sign releases after, and including SA 3.3.0:

pub   4096R/F7D39814 2009-12-02
      Key fingerprint = D809 9BC7 9E17 D7E4 9BC2  1E31 FDE5 2F40 F7D3 9814
uid                  SpamAssassin Project Management Committee <private@spamassassin.apache.org>
uid                  SpamAssassin Signing Key (Code Signing Key, replacement for 1024D/265FA05B) <dev@spamassassin.apache.org>
sub   4096R/7B3265A5 2009-12-02

The following key is used to sign rule updates:

pub   4096R/5244EC45 2005-12-20
      Key fingerprint = 5E54 1DC9 59CB 8BAC 7C78  DFDC 4056 A61A 5244 EC45
uid                  updates.spamassassin.org Signing Key <release@spamassassin.org>
sub   4096R/24F434CE 2005-12-20

To verify a release file, download the file with the accompanying .asc
file and run the following commands:

  gpg --verbose --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key FDE52F40F7D39814
  gpg --verify Mail-SpamAssassin-3.4.5.tar.bz2.asc
  gpg --fingerprint FDE52F40F7D39814

Then verify that the key matches the signature.

Note that older versions of gnupg may not be able to complete the steps
above. Specifically, GnuPG v1.0.6, 1.0.7 & 1.2.6 failed while v1.4.11
worked flawlessly.

on verifying Apache releases.


About Apache SpamAssassin
-------------------------

Apache SpamAssassin is a mature, widely-deployed open source project
that serves as a mail filter to identify spam. SpamAssassin uses a
variety of mechanisms including mail header and text analysis, Bayesian
filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases. In
addition, Apache SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows
other technologies to be quickly incorporated as an addition or as a
replacement for existing methods.

Apache SpamAssassin typically runs on a server, classifies and labels
spam before it reaches your mailbox, while allowing other components of
a mail system to act on its results.

Most of the Apache SpamAssassin is written in Perl, with heavily
traversed code paths carefully optimized. Benefits are portability,
robustness and facilitated maintenance. It can run on a wide variety of
POSIX platforms.

The server and the Perl library feels at home on Unix and Linux platforms
and reportedly also works on MS Windows systems under ActivePerl.
