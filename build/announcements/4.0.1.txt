modules.

Many thanks to the committers (see CREDITS file), contributors, rule
testers, mass checkers, and code testers who have made this release
possible.

Notable changes
---------------

This release addresses the following issues:

  - Incompatibilities with some versions of perl and some perl modules
    that have been released since the release of SpamAssassin 4.0.0

  - Problems using cpan to install SpamAssassin when certain required
    or optional modules are not already installed

  - Support for space characters in the path name of some executables
    used by certain plugins

  - Improved handling of URL shortener link redirects

  - Improved TxRep locking management

  - Added Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::AuthRes plugin to use
    Authentication-Results header fields in other plugins

  - Added a Pyzor Perl implementation

  - Perl crash when certain uri_detail rules processed some messages
    with UTF-8 characters

  - Inconsistent handling of newlines in header rules

  - Text or HTML content placed in octet-stream attachments by
    spammers to bypass SpamAssassin scanning

  - Implemented TCP fallback for truncated DNS UDP replies

* Spamc can now be built on a Windows platform as part of the gmake
  build procedure, using the compiler toolchain that is part of a
  standard Strawberry Perl installation, with no need to install a
  separate Visual Studio, msys, or mingw.

GPG Verification Procedure
--------------------------
The release files also have a .asc accompanying them.  The file serves
as an external GPG signature for the given release file.  The signing
key is available via the keys.gnupg.net or keys.openpgp.org key
servers, as well as https://www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin/KEYS


The following key is used to sign SA releases 3.3.0 and later:

pub   4096R/F7D39814 2009-12-02
      Key fingerprint = D809 9BC7 9E17 D7E4 9BC2  1E31 FDE5 2F40 F7D3 9814
uid                  SpamAssassin Project Management Committee <private@spamassassin.apache.org>
uid                  SpamAssassin Signing Key (Code Signing Key, replacement for 1024D/265FA05B) <dev@spamassassin.apache.org>
sub   4096R/7B3265A5 2009-12-02

The following key is used to sign rule updates:

pub   4096R/5244EC45 2005-12-20
      Key fingerprint = 5E54 1DC9 59CB 8BAC 7C78  DFDC 4056 A61A 5244 EC45
uid                  updates.spamassassin.org Signing Key <release@spamassassin.org>
sub   4096R/24F434CE 2005-12-20

To verify a release file, download the file with the accompanying .asc
file and run the following commands:

  gpg --verbose --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-key FDE52F40F7D39814
  gpg --verify Mail-SpamAssassin-4.0.0.tar.bz2.asc
  gpg --fingerprint FDE52F40F7D39814

Then confirm that the key description shown by --verify matches what
is shown by --fingerprint.

About Apache SpamAssassin
-------------------------

Apache SpamAssassin is a mature, widely-deployed open source project
that provides filtering to classify email to block spam, malware, and
phishes.

Apache SpamAssassin uses a variety of mechanisms including mail header
and text analysis, Bayesian filtering, DNS blocklists, collaborative
filtering databases, and meta concepts to lower incorrect
classification.

Apache SpamAssassin uses a highly modular architecture that allows
other technologies to be quickly incorporated as plugins to easily add
or replace existing methods.

Apache SpamAssassin typically runs on a server using either command
line utilities or an API to classify email so a mail system can use
the results before the message reaches mailboxes.

Most of the Apache SpamAssassin is written in Perl natively supporting
Unix, Linux, and macOS platforms and Microsoft Windows using
Strawberry Perl.
