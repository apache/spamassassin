SPAMASSASSIN DEVELOPMENT SNAPSHOT PROCEDURE
===========================================

- cd to the directory for the codebase you want the devel tree to
  come from

    ssh people.apache.org
    cd [checkedoutdir]

- ensure the required code and data is available for the build scripts:

    $HOME/sabuildtools

  All can be copied (or symlinked) from ~jm on people.apache.org if
  required.

- ensure your PATH is correct, with the right perl FIRST in the path:

    PATH=$HOME/sabuildtools/perl584/bin:$HOME/sabuildtools/bin:$PATH

- run "./build/update_devel" to build the tar.gz files.

- next run "./build/update_devel_rules" to build the rules tarball.

- by default, they're written to ~/public_html/devel/ . 
  Copy them to wherever you want, yourself.


SPAMASSASSIN RELEASE PROCEDURE
==============================

- First off, log in to people.apache.org for some preliminary tool
  checks.

    ssh people.apache.org

- ensure the required code and data is available for the build scripts:
  see above.

- ensure your PATH is correct, with the right perl FIRST in the path:

    PATH=$HOME/sabuildtools/perl584/bin:$HOME/sabuildtools/bin:$PATH



- In your own, writable, checkout (this may be on another host instead
  of people.apache.org, such as your home machine):

  Run "svn status" to ensure you're building/releasing from a pristine
  checkout:

    cd [checkedoutdir]
    svn status

  The output should look like this:

  X      rulesrc

  Performing status on external item at 'rulesrc'

  (no "M" or "C" files; any files marked "M" have been locally modified,
  and should be "svn revert"ed before you continue.)

- edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm and comment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD
  line.   Ensure the correct version number is present in $VERSION
  and $EXTRA_VERSION.

  Prereleases: formatted like this: "pre4" -- in $EXTRA_VERSION, and
  $IS_DEVEL_BUILD is left as 1 instead of commented. When referred to in
  full, it's "3.1.0-pre4".

  Release candidates: formatted like this: "rc2" -- in $EXTRA_VERSION, and
  $IS_DEVEL_BUILD is commented. When referred to in full, it's "3.1.0-rc2".

  [NOTE: when editing files in these instructions, you may have to
  use another checkout somewhere else, check in the changes there,
  then 'svn update' in the release account -- since I think it
  builds from a read-only checkout.]

- check "spamassassin.spec" has the right version number in the
  "%define real_version" line.  Fix if not.

- Ensure the new version number takes hold:

    make clean ; perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null ; make
    ./spamassassin -L -t < sample-nonspam.txt | grep X-Spam-

  Verify that the X-Spam-* headers use the correct version string,
  without an SVN revision number (those are only for dev builds).

- create the Changes file.  Do this step on your own checkout, as
  the release checkout is read-only.   There are two options here:

  - For releases on a maintainance branch (e.g. 3.0.1, .2, etc.):

      TZ=UTC svn log --non-interactive --stop-on-copy > Changes

    This will output all of the changes since the .0 release in the
    current branch (the last copy -- note, if a copy was done
    afterwards (move between repositories, etc, you'll need to
    modify that command).

  - For releases on the trunk (e.g. a .0 release):

      TZ=UTC svn log -r HEAD:497472 --non-interactive > Changes

    r497472 was the release of 3.2.0-pre1; r233108 was the start of 3.2.0,
    just after the 3.1.0 branch was created; r46030 was the start of the
    3.1.0 work (created 3.0 branch); replace with the correct rev number
    for the point you want to start at if different.

- run "make distcheck" to ensure all files are included in the
  distribution that should be, and to ensure all files that are listed
  in the MANIFEST also exist in SVN.

    make distcheck

- run "make disttest" to ensure all default tests pass once the
  distribution is fully packaged.  (this'll take a minute or two.)

    make disttest < /dev/null

- run the release test suite, which forces all tests to run and also
  applies an additional, more stringent set of tests.  This may require
  "sudo" privileges on your test box, and unusual CPAN modules like
  "Devel::SawAmpersand", so you may have to skip some of this or ignore
  some spurious failures.

    prove -v xt

- Check in the updated Changes file, and SpamAssassin.pm.

    svn commit -m "preparing to release X.Y.Z"

  (If you are privately preparing a security release, and don't wish to
  perform commits to public SVN repos, you can defer this step until
  later.)

- SVN tag the release files.  This is done using "svn copy".
  For a maintainance release (x.y.1, x.y.2):

    vers=3_1_7

  For a trunk release (x.y.0):

    vers=3_0_0

  For a trunk pre-release (x.y.0-preZ) or alpha (x.y.0-alphaZ):

    vers=3_3_0_alpha_2

  Then run

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn delete -m "replaced old tag" $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release $vers" \
	$repo/trunk $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers

  This will do a completely server-side tagging (which is the same as
  a branch really) of whatever the latest branch revision to be the new
  base of the tag release.

  (If you are privately preparing a security release, and don't wish to
  perform commits to public SVN repos, you can defer this step until
  later.)


- In your checkout on people.apache.org (may be read-only):

  Check out the code from the tag you just made:

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    rm -rf ~/relbuild
    svn co $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_2_0_pre_2 ~/relbuild
    cd ~/relbuild

  (If you are privately preparing a security release, you will need
  to ensure that the code in this build directory matches up using
  some other mechanism, since SVN is public.)

- run "./build/update_stable" to build the tar.gz files.

    PATH=$HOME/sabuildtools/perl584/bin:$HOME/sabuildtools/bin:$PATH
    ./build/update_stable

  You will need the SSH password for
  updatesd@spamassassin.zones.apache.org.  If you don't have this,
  ask Justin.  If that fails, log into the zone machine as yourself
  and reset it.

  if you get "gpg-agent" errors about not connecting to the PIN entry
  module, you didn't update your $PATH.

- take a copy of the MD5sum line output.

- test the tar.gz and zip files!  redo until they work!! ;)

- Write the release announcement mail!  This is a simple matter of copying
  the previous release's announcement, updating the version numbers and
  links, fixing the MD5 and SHA1 checksums in this mail, and summarising
  the important changes from the Changes file.

    cp build/announcements/3.1.7.txt build/announcements/3.1.8.txt
    svn add !$
    vi !$

- (for any rc, prerelease, or full release) Place the tarballs in a
  discreet location (discreet means not linked from the "downloads" page
  of the website, but included in the vote mail) and request a vote on the
  development mailing list to make the release.  Post the URL,
  md5sums/sha1sums, and proposed release announcement mail to the dev
  list.  The default location -- ~/public_html/devel/ , or
  http://people.apache.org/~jm/devel/ , qualifies as "discreet".
  
  While doing this, also upload a copy of the proposed release
  announcement to the website:

    version=3.2.4
    cp build/announcements/$version.txt ~/public_html/devel/PROPOSED-$version.txt

  Pre-releases and RCs require just lazy consensus -- ie. no objections.

- (for a full release) You need 3 +1's from PMC members. The release
  manager (that's you) may vote as well.  Once there are three or more +1
  votes, you may proceed.

- If you've been doing some steps in private, for a security release,
  now's the time to perform them publicly; tagging etc.

- Edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm, and uncomment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD line.
  SVN commit it (and the release announcement file from above, if
  you made one):

	svn commit -m "X.Y.Z RELEASED"

- [X.Y.0 RELEASES ONLY]: Now, start the new development codebase.  For
  minor updates of a 2.x tree (e.g. 2.x.1, 2.x.2), you don't need to
  branch; for major updates (2.x.0) you need to create a new development
  branch, off the trunk.

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn copy $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_1_0 \
           $repo/branches/3.1

  "trunk" is SVN's concept of head.  Typically, our branches are named
  for their minor version number.  In the example above, b3_1_0 is the
  branch for the stable 3.1.x releases.

- In the new development codeline, edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm
  and bump the $VERSION line to the correct version.

- In the new development codeline, edit spamassassin.spec, and bump the
  version number in the "%define real_version" line.

- then, commit the new version number to the new branch:

        svn commit -m "X.Y.N devel cycle started"

	(where X.Y.N is the new version number)

- !WARNING! After the next step, the version number will be considered
  "burned". The number is locked for this particular code.  The same
  number cannot be used for a future different release.  So make sure
  you're happy before you go on!

  If you need to redo something, re-comment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD line,
  revert the $VERSION bump, and go back to 'Ensure the new version number
  takes hold'.  You can retag with the normal 'svn copy' command used in
  'SVN tag the release files', even if that tag already existed; but be
  sure to check in another commit message to note what happened, e.g.:

    svn commit -m "oops, had to redo: THIS IS THE REAL X.Y.Z RELEASE"

- publish the tarballs.

  (for rc and prerelease builds) copy the tarballs to the website.
  ASF bylaws prohibit the distribution of files claiming to be
  releases from the website, without 3 PMC +1 votes, so you need to
  make it clear that this is an unofficial "test build" by placing it
  in your public_html dir:

        http://people.apache.org/~jm/rc/

  this command will do it:

        version=X.Y.Z
        cp -p ~/public_html/devel/Mail-SpamAssassin*-$version.* \
            ~/public_html/rc/

  (for full release builds) copy the tarballs to www.apache.org/dist:

        version=X.Y.Z
        cp -p ~/public_html/devel/Mail-SpamAssassin*-$version.* \
            /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin/source

        cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin
        cp -p source/Mail-SpamAssassin*-$version.* .

        chmod -R g+w /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin

  [note: the ASF archives documentation claims that symlinks are
  supported. This is not the case for some mirrors, so use "cp" instead.]

  (for full release builds) remove release tarballs from now-obsolete
  versions from dist:

        cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin
        prev=X.Y.notZ
        rm -f source/Mail-SpamAssassin*-$prev.* Mail-SpamAssassin*-$prev.*
        rm -f binaries/*/Mail-SpamAssassin*-$prev.*

  (Archive copies are automatically kept on archive.apache.org/dist/ .)

- (for full release builds) update the main website "downloads" page:

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        vi main.wmk

  See the comment at the top of the file; you'll need to change at
  least one variable ("relversion") to the new version number, and
  possibly more, depending on if this is the first release of a new
  release line.

  TODO: for the first 3.3.0 release, we'll need to add a section allowing
  people to download the rules tarball as well.

- Release a new rules update matching the released code:

    ssh spamassassin.zones.apache.org
    cd /home/updatesd/svn/spamassassin/build/mkupdates
    sudo -H -u updatesd ./update-rules 3.3

- rebuild the SpamAssassin website with webmake:

        PATH=$HOME/sabuildtools/perl584/bin:$HOME/sabuildtools/bin:$PATH
        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        webmake -F

- update the 'doc' tree in the SpamAssassin website (WARNING: if you're
  moving to a new major release, x.y.0, you need to edit
  'build/update_website_docs' beforehand and set the "vers" line):

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        svn up
        svn delete --force full/3.3.x
        svn commit -m "removing old doc tree from website" full

        cd [checkedoutdir]
        build/update_website_docs

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        svn add full/3.3.x
        svn commit -m "updating new doc tree on website" full

- and check the entire website into SVN (see bug 4998 for reasons why).
  Note that you may need to resolve conflicts and ensure the contents of
  'full/3.3.x' are all added successfully:

        svn up
        svn commit -m "added new release to website"

- update the tag used to point to "current release":

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn delete -m "updating for new release" \
	$repo/tags/spamassassin_current_release_3.3.x
    svn copy -m "updating for new release" \
	$repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_3_0 \
	$repo/tags/spamassassin_current_release_3.3.x

- upload release .tar.gz (not .bz2) tarball to CPAN at http://pause.cpan.org/:

        https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri

  (Note that recently, PAUSE has started indexing sub-modules under
  Mail::SpamAssassin::, and it can't deal with our multi-maintainer
  setup.  You may receive mail indicating that "indexing failed" after
  the upload; as long as the main Mail::SpamAssassin module was indexed
  correctly, this is fine.  However, it would help if you could visit

        https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

  select 3.1 ("Make someone else co-maintainer"), and ensure that the
  other releasers (JMASON, DOS, FELICITY, others?) all have permissions as
  'co-maintainer' on the full set of your listed modules in the
  "Mail::SpamAssassin::" namespace.

- announce on the users, dev, and announce mailing lists using the
  previously-prepared release announcement.

  NOTE: you must send this mail with a "From:" address @apache.org,
  otherwise it'll be bounced by the ASF's custom spam filtering
  rules.

- Before doing the next step, run through the release summary mail, and
  write up a really short summary of the important changes in
  human-readable format.  This should be less than 600 chars to fit into
  Freshmeat's format, and to be easily understandable.

- announce to Freshmeat at http://freshmeat.net/:

        http://freshmeat.net/add-release/14876/

- Approve the posting to the announce list (the list admins will get a
  mail indicating how to do this.)

- Add the new version to the Bugzilla versions list:

        http://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/editversions.cgi?product=Spamassassin&action=add

- Add a milestone for the next version to the Bugzilla milestones list:

        https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/editmilestones.cgi?action=add&product=Spamassassin
        (use a sortkey of "0")

- Change the sortkey for the previous release's milestone from "0" to "10":

        https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/editmilestones.cgi?product=Spamassassin
