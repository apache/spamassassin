APACHE SPAMASSASSIN RELEASE PROCEDURE
=====================================

- First off, checkout the branch or trunk you wish to build.  I usually do
  this as a privileged user in a build.tmp directory.

- As the release gets close, consider switching to R-T-C development
  mode: https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/DevelopmentMode

- Using DNS resolvers like 8.8.8.8 did NOT work.  It causes spurious
  failures on things like dnsbl.t.  Use a real DNS server.

- To build a release you need gpg, a few perl modules, re2c
  and the signing key for the project. For CentOS 7.5, the following worked:

  - yum install perl* 
  - yum remover perl-homedir

  - using source and CPAN as root
    - compiled razor-agents
    - cpan install Net::Patricia
    - cpan install Geo::IP
    - cpan install Devel::SawAmpersand
    - custom compiled re2c with  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

  - when you run perl Makefile.PL, you want full dependencies such as this
    snippet:

    checking module dependencies and their versions...
    checking binary dependencies and their versions...
    <snip>
    dependency check complete...

    optional binary missing or nonfunctional: fetch

  - NOTE: Missing Fetch is ok if we have wget or curl.  You just need 1 of
    the 3.

  - You need ~/sabuildtools/bin with a symlink to gpg

  - You need ~/sabuildtoosl/sasigningkey with chmod 700 

  - You need the passphrase to the sasigning key

- Ensure ExtUtils::MakeMaker is version 6.46 or later, to create
  a detailed-enough META.yml 

    perl -MExtUtils::MakeMaker -e 'print $ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION'

- Run "svn status" to ensure you're building/releasing from a pristine
  checkout:

    cd [checkedoutdir]
    svn status

  The output should be blank or look like this:

  ?       rules
  ?       rulesrc
  ?       t.rules

  (ie., no "M" or "C" files; any files marked "M" have been locally
  modified, and should be "svn revert"ed before you continue.)

- Rule Source is only in trunk.  If you are building a branch, checkout 
  trunk as well and symlink it, i.e. rulesrc -> ../trunk/rulesrc/

- t.rule Source is only in trunk.  If you are building a branch, checkout
  trunk as well and symlink it, i.e. t.rules -> ../trunk/t.rules/

- Rules are ONLY published from trunk.  Rule development should use plugin
  and version conditions to make it so one ruleset works on all modern
  versions of SA. If you are building a branch, checkout trunk as well and
  symlink the rules from trunk, i.e. rules -> ../trunk/rules/

  With the rules in trunk symlinked, you can expect MANIFEST warnings when
  running things such as make distclean such as:

    No such file: rules/20_aux_tlds.cf
    No such file: rules/active.list
    No such file: rules/init.pre
    No such file: rules/languages
    No such file: rules/local.cf
    No such file: rules/regression_tests.cf
    No such file: rules/sa-update-pubkey.txt
    No such file: rules/user_prefs.template
    No such file: rules/v310.pre
    No such file: rules/v312.pre
    No such file: rules/v320.pre
    No such file: rules/v330.pre
    No such file: rules/v340.pre
    No such file: rules/v341.pre
    No such file: rules/v342.pre

  NOTE: Don't remove the lines from the MANIFEST though!

- Consider updating the TLD list in 20_aux_tlds.cf.  As of 4/6/2015,
  this is not automated but bug 7165 is open for this purpose.

- edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm and comment out the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD
  line as noted. Ensure the correct version number is present in $VERSION
  and @EXTRA_VERSION.

  Prereleases: formatted like this: "pre4" -- in $EXTRA_VERSION, and
  $IS_DEVEL_BUILD is 0. When referred to in full, it's "3.1.0-pre4".

  Release candidates: formatted like this: "rc2" -- in $EXTRA_VERSION, and
  $IS_DEVEL_BUILD is 0. When referred to in full, it's "3.1.0-rc2".

  $IS_DEVEL_BUILD is 0 even with rc and pre versions because rc and pre
  numbers are never reused.  Just increment higher each time.

  Full releases: @EXTRA_VERSION is blank and IS_DEVEL_BUILD is 0.

- Ensure the new version number takes hold:

    make clean ; perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null ; make
    ./spamassassin -L -t < sample-nonspam.txt | grep X-Spam-

  Verify that the X-Spam-* headers use the correct version string,
  without an SVN revision number (those are only for dev and pre builds).

  NOTE: If the date is old, don't worry, it will change later with the
        relbuild checkout.

  Also, a warning about "warn: config: could not find site rules
  directory" is ok too.  It's because no init.pre exists in the default
  rules location.

- create the Changes file.  

  NOTE: If you do not use a fresh checkout, you may miss recent entries if
  you also did development on the same checkout.  Use a fresh checkout
  when making your builds to avoid this issue.

  MAKE CERTAIN THIS IS RUN IN THE ROOT OF YOUR CHECKOUT!

  There are two options here:

  - For releases on a maintenance branch (e.g. 3.0.1, .2, etc.):

      TZ=UTC svn log --non-interactive --stop-on-copy > Changes

    This will output all of the changes since the .0 release in the
    current branch (the last copy -- note, if a copy was done
    afterwards (move between repositories, etc, you'll need to
    modify that command).

  - For releases on the trunk (e.g. a .0 release):

      TZ=UTC svn log -r HEAD:1567124 --non-interactive > Changes

    r497472 was the release of 3.2.0-pre1; r233108 was the start of 3.2.0,
    just after the 3.1.0 branch was created; r46030 was the start of the
    3.1.0 work (created 3.0 branch); replace with the correct rev number
    for the point you want to start at if different. I used r1149751 to
    produce the first 3.4.0-pre release, for example.  r1567124 is the
    3.4.0 release tag revision.  r1676613 is the 3.4.1 release tag
    revision.

    To find the release tag revision, use the tags website, i.e.: 
      https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/tags/

    NOTE: 3.4.1 is currently on trunk and will be branched to 3.4 because 
    3.4 branch was not used.

- Exclude some automated changes from the logs:

    cat Changes | perl -ne ' BEGIN{$/=("-"x72)."\n"}
    chomp; @ln=split/^/;
    next if @ln==3 && $ln[2]=~/^\s*(updated scores for revision.*|promotions validated|auto-generated rules|)\s*$/;
    print "@ln$/"' > Changes.tmp

- Word wrap the Changes file with something like 

    fold -sw 74 Changes.tmp > Changes && rm -f Changes.tmp

- run "make distcheck" to ensure all files are included in the
  distribution that should be, and to ensure all files that are listed
  in the MANIFEST also exist in SVN.

    make distcheck

  With the rules in trunk symlinked, you can expect MANIFEST warnings when
  running things such as make distclean such as:

    No such file: rules/20_aux_tlds.cf
    No such file: rules/active.list
    No such file: rules/init.pre
    No such file: rules/languages
    No such file: rules/local.cf
    No such file: rules/regression_tests.cf
    No such file: rules/sa-update-pubkey.txt
    No such file: rules/user_prefs.template
    No such file: rules/v310.pre
    No such file: rules/v312.pre
    No such file: rules/v320.pre
    No such file: rules/v330.pre
    No such file: rules/v340.pre
    No such file: rules/v341.pre
    No such file: rules/v342.pre

  NOTE: Don't remove the lines from the MANIFEST though!

- run "make disttest" to ensure all default tests pass once the
  distribution is fully packaged.  (this takes ~12 1/2 minutes on my system
  2018-09-01)

    make disttest < /dev/null

- run the release test suite, which forces all tests to run and also
  applies an additional, more stringent set of tests.  This may require
  "sudo" privileges on your test box, and unusual CPAN modules like
  "Devel::SawAmpersand", so you might have to skip some of this or ignore
  some spurious failures. For example, I don't have re2c or dcc installed
  on my devel system so I fail xt/50_dcc & xt/50_sa_compile.


  Additionally, this will run tests such as the spamd prefork which will
  kill all running spamd processes.  This release test suite is intended
  for a development environment.

    NOTE: These likely must run as root. Some tests prompt for sudo.

    make test TEST_FILES="xt/*.t"

    FAILURE NOTES: 

	  50_razor2.t - you need to register for razor
          and the sample of a bad email may have fallen
          out of their database.

    A failure on the xt/ tests does not necessarily block a release.  
    The xt tests are intended for people rolling an SA release or custom 
    package.  Expect the DCC tests to fail if DCC is not installed, etc.


- Check in the updated Changes file, and SpamAssassin.pm.

    svn commit -m "preparing to release X.Y.Z"

  (If you are privately preparing a security release, and don't wish to
  perform commits to public SVN repos, you can defer this step until
  later.)

- SVN tag the release files.  This is done using "svn copy".

  - For a maintenance release (x.y.1, x.y.2):

    vers=3_4_3

    Then run:

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn delete -m "replaced old tag" $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release $vers" $repo/branches/3.4 $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers


  - For a maintenance release candidate(x.y.1-rc1), pre-release (x.y.1-preZ) or alpha (x.y.1-alphaZ):

    vers=3_4_3_rc_1

    #Then run:

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn delete -m "replaced old tag" $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release $vers" $repo/branches/3.4 $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers


  - For a trunk release (x.y.0):

    vers=3_4_0

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn delete -m "replaced old tag" $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release $vers" \
        $repo/trunk $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers

  - For a trunk release candidate (x.y.0-rc1), pre-release (x.y.0-preZ) or alpha (x.y.0-alphaZ):

    vers=3_4_0_rc_2

    Then run:

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn delete -m "replaced old tag" $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release $vers" $repo/trunk $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers

    
  This will do a completely server-side tagging (which is the same as
  a branch really) of whatever the latest branch revision to be the new
  base of the tag release.

  (If you are privately preparing a security release, and don't wish to
  perform commits to public SVN repos, you can defer this step until
  later.)


- Check out the code from the tag you just made:

    #Switch to a non-privileged user
    vers=3_4_3
    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    rm -rf ~/relbuild
    svn co $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers ~/relbuild
    cd ~/relbuild

  (If you are privately preparing a security release, you will need
  to ensure that the code in this build directory matches up using
  some other mechanism, since SVN is public.)

- run "./build/update_stable" to build the tar.gz, tar.bz2 and zip files.

    NOTE: link rules, t.rules and rulesrc to a trunk checkout if needed!

    killall gpg-agent
    #THESE ARE NOT NEEDED FOR A TRUNK RELEASE
    ln -s ~/usr/src/Mail-SpamAssassin/trunk/rules
    ln -s ~/usr/src/Mail-SpamAssassin/trunk/rulesrc
    ln -s ~/usr/src/Mail-SpamAssassin/trunk/t.rules
    ./build/update_stable

  NOTE: running gpg-agent with the proper homedir is needed for
  non-privileged users.

# This step is part of the step above already
#
#- run "./build/repackage_latest_update_rules" package a rule file for 
#  people who can't run sa-update:
#
#    ./build/repackage_latest_update_rules
#
#  WARNING: this will use the most recently-created "sa-update" tarball for
#  the rules tgz, so if changes have been committed to the "rules" dir in
#  SVN since then, they will not be released!
#

- test the files!  redo until they work!! ;)

- Write the release announcement mail!  This is a simple matter of copying
  the previous release's announcement, updating the version numbers and
  links, fixing the MD5 and SHA1 checksums in this mail, and summarising
  the important changes from the Changes file.

    cp build/announcements/3.4.1.txt build/announcements/3.4.2.txt
    svn add !$
    vi !$

  NOTE: Here's a quick example to concat the checksums:
        ls *3.4.2* | grep sha | xargs cat --

- If there are any issues to note, make sure to edit the UPGRADE file.
  Every x.x.0 release at a minimum should include a section.

- Check the README file for any items to change.

- Review the CREDITS to update Committers - https://whimsy.apache.org/
  can help with this.

- Review the CREDITS to update Copyright

- Review the Project Branding Report Checklist at
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs

- (for any rc, prerelease, or full release) Place the tarballs in a
  discreet location (discreet means not linked from the "downloads" page
  of the website, but included in the vote mail) and request a vote on the
  development mailing list to make the release.  Post the URL,
  SHA sums, and proposed release announcement mail to the dev list.  

    https://people.apache.org/~kmcgrail/devel/ qualifies as "discreet".

  Pre-releases and RCs require just lazy consensus -- ie. no objections.

  NOTE: It's also feasible that you could publish via SVNPubSub as noted
  below but using the SVN repository at:

    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/SpamAssassin

- (for a pre or rc release), - upload .tar.gz (not .bz2) tarball to CPAN
  at https://pause.cpan.org/:

        https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri

  See notes below for issues on indexing but the tar should be named in a 
  manner that CPAN will process it as a Developer Release per

  https://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html#developerreleases

  As of 2014-02-05, adding -TRIAL to the filename should work. For example:

        Mail-SpamAssassin-3.4.1-rc2-TRIAL.tar.gz

- (for a full release) 3 +1's votes from PMC members are required to 
  proceed with an official, non pre-release ASF software release.

- If you've been doing some steps in private, for a security release,
  now's the time to perform them publicly; tagging etc.

- Edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm, and uncomment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD line.
  SVN commit it (and the release announcement file from above, if
  you made one):

	svn commit -m "X.Y.Z RELEASED"

- [X.Y.0 RELEASES ONLY]: Now, start the new development codebase.  For
  minor updates of a 2.x tree (e.g. 2.x.1, 2.x.2), you don't need to
  branch; for major updates (2.x.0) you need to create a new development
  branch, off the trunk.

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn copy $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_4_1 $repo/branches/3.4 \
    -m 'Creating 3.4 branch based on 3.4.1 so that trunk can go to 4.0'

  "trunk" is SVN's concept of head.  Typically, our branches are named
  for their minor version number.  In the example above, 3.4 is the
  branch for the stable 3.4.x releases.

  - In the new development codebase, edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm
    and bump the $VERSION line to the correct version.

  - then, commit the new version number to the new branch:

        svn commit -m "X.Y.N devel cycle started"

	(where X.Y.N is the new version number)

- [X.Y.0 RELEASES ONLY]: in trunk, bump the version to the correct
  version in the following files (just as above for the branch):

  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm


#- In build/mkupdates/run_part2 change versions="X.Y.Z" to the new
#  development version (A.B.C).

- DNS Steps TBD - Talk to sysadmins@spamassassin.apache.org

#- [X.Y.0 RELEASES ONLY]: NOTE: This may change, make sure this info is
#  still accurate before changing this (preferrably find out BEFORE doing
#  an X.Y.0 release.  Update the mkupdates stuff:

#  - Create an empty file for the new version number in
#    /var/named/updates.dev.spamassassin.org.d/ on the zone and chown to
#    updatesd and chgrp to others.
#
#    NOTE: I don't believe this does anything KAM: 2014-02-11 and the
#    directory doesn't exist.

#  - Add "$INCLUDE /var/named/updates.spamassassin.org.d/X.Y+1.0" to the
#    /var/named/spamassassin.org zone file OR use a CNAME (see below)
#
#    NOTE: Per bug 6644, using a CNAME for 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 4.0.0 to 3.3.2

#  - commit the changes, update the zone (if not doing above on the zone -
#    NOTE: See /var/named/README) and tick the zone file using build/mkupdates/tick_zone_serial

- !WARNING! After the next step, the version number will be considered
  "burned". The number is locked for this particular code.  The same
  number cannot be used for a future different release.  So make sure
  you're happy before you go on!

  If you need to redo something, re-comment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD line,
  revert the $VERSION bump, and go back to 'Ensure the new version number
  takes hold'.  You can retag with the normal 'svn copy' command used in
  'SVN tag the release files', even if that tag already existed; but be
  sure to check in another commit message to note what happened, e.g.:

    svn commit -m "oops, had to redo: THIS IS THE REAL X.Y.Z RELEASE"

#- Release a new rules update matching the released code:
#  #2014-02-11 switched to su - instead of sudo because of .ssh and .svn
#  stored config items
#
#        ssh spamassassin.zones.apache.org
#        su - updatesd
#        cd /home/updatesd/svn/spamassassin/build/mkupdates
#        ./update-rules-3.3 3.4
#
#  NOTE: Is this needed with our rule update process?  not convinced it
#  is... 2015-04-28

- publish the tarballs

  ASF bylaws prohibit the distribution of files claiming to be
  releases from the website, without 3 PMC +1 votes, so you need to
  make it clear that this is an unofficial "test build" by placing it
  in your public_html dir:

        https://people.apache.org/~kmcgrail/devel/ for example

  NOTE: It's also feasible that you could publish via SVNPubSub as noted 
  below but using the SVN repository at:

    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/SpamAssassin

  The choice is up to the Release Manager for these test builds.


  For full release builds, you need to publish using SVNPubSub.
 
  This is a simple matter of committing the new artifacts and signature 
  files to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/spamassassin/ once a
  release vote passes. 

  [note: Symlinks may not work on all mirrors even though there may be 
  documentation to the contrary.]

  As documented at https://www.apache.org/dev/release.html, SpamAssassin
  as of 2014-02-26 publishes tarballs by manipulating the repo on svn.

  svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/spamassassin/ release

  - Manipulate the files to add the new version artifacts to the source dir
  - Remove tar-balls for now-obsolete versions from dist:

    Only the most recent version of each supported release line should be
    stored.  The archives will auto update.  
    See https://www.apache.org/dev/release#archived.
  - Commit 
  - Wait 24 hours before you announce to allow mirrors to update

  (NOTE: it may be better to wait a while before doing this; it appears to
  take a while for the spamassassin.apache.org website mirror script to
  run, so the old downloads page will stick around for a while before it's
  safe to do so.)

- (for full release builds) update the main website "downloads.html" and
  all the links to downloads.cgi on all the pages in svn:

    https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/site

  When changing the timestamp in the downloads.cgi link URL, ensure you
  use a time 2 hours from now.  The ASF websites are synced internally to
  the public HTTP servers on a bi-hourly basis, so it may take up to this
  long for a file-download link to become valid and not a 404.

- Update the "news.html" and the announcement on the home page.

- Log on to: https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?spamassassin
  and add your release data (version and date) to the database.

- update the 'doc' tree in the SpamAssassin website 

  WARNING: edit 'build/update_website_docs' beforehand and set the "PERL"
  "WEBDIR" and "vers" lines.  On my build system, the website checkout is
  in ~/asf/Mail-SpamAssassin/site and perl is in the path so nothing special is
  needed.

        #If needed, remove the old docs - This will be different for v4.0
        cd ~/asf/Mail-SpamAssassin/site
        svn up
        svn delete --force full/3.4.x
        svn commit -m "removing old doc tree from website" 

        #Checkout the current release
        cd /tmp
        svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/tags/spamassassin_release_3_4_3/ release
        cd /tmp/release
        #link your rules and rulesrc
        ln -s ~/usr/src/Mail-SpamAssassin/trunk/rules
        ln -s ~/usr/src/Mail-SpamAssassin/trunk/rulesrc 
        build/update_website_docs

        cd ~/asf/Mail-SpamAssassin/site
        svn add full/3.4.x
        svn commit -m "updating new doc tree on website" full

- update the tag used to point to "current release":

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    vers=3_4_3
    svn delete -m "updating for new release"  $repo/tags/spamassassin_current_release_3.4.x
    svn copy -m "updating for new release" $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_$vers $repo/tags/spamassassin_current_release_3.4.x

- upload release .tar.gz (not .bz2) tarball to CPAN at https://pause.cpan.org/:

        https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri

  (Note that recently, PAUSE has started indexing sub-modules under
  Mail::SpamAssassin::, and it can't deal with our multi-maintainer
  setup.  You may receive mail indicating that "indexing failed" after
  the upload; as long as the main Mail::SpamAssassin module was indexed
  correctly, this is fine.  However, it would help if you could visit

        https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=share_perms

  select 3.1 ("Make someone else co-maintainer"), and ensure that the
  other releasers (JMASON, DOS, FELICITY, others?) all have permissions as
  'co-maintainer' on the full set of your listed modules in the
  "Mail::SpamAssassin::" namespace.

- announce on the users@spamassassin.apache.org,
  dev@spamassassin.apache.org, announce@spamassassin.apache.org and the
  announce@apache.org  mailing lists using the previously-prepared release 
  announcement.

  **IMPORTANT: Address the email to yourself as the To:, Bcc: all lists
  and set a Reply-To: of dev@spamassassin.apache.org.

  NOTE: you must send this mail with a "From:" address @apache.org,
  otherwise it'll be bounced by the ASF's custom spam filtering
  rules.  See [1] below for more requirements for the announce email.

- Approve the posting to the announce list (the list admins will get a
  mail indicating how to do this.)

- Add the new version to the Bugzilla versions list:

        https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/editversions.cgi?product=Spamassassin&action=add

- Add a milestone for the next version to the Bugzilla milestones list:

        https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/editmilestones.cgi?action=add&product=Spamassassin
        (use a sortkey of "0")

- Confirm with SpamAssassin SysAdmins group that we are ready in DNS for
  masscheck and rule updates for the next version

  For many years all releases since 3.3.3 use the same ruleset.  
    3.4.2 already has a cname for this.  
    3.3.2 and before are set to a static ruleset.  

  We have been good on using version specific and plugin conditions to 
  allow one ruleset to rule them all.  

  Since we plan to release rules that continue to be version compatible 
  back to 3.3.3, only a CNAME is needed for newer releases to point at 
  3.3.3.

- Change the sortkey for the previous release's milestone from "0" to "10":

        https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/editmilestones.cgi?product=Spamassassin

- Update https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpamAssassin

Hello PMCs --a quick reminder that messages sent to announce@apache.org
feature prominently in the weekly Apache News Round-ups [1].

In order for your announcement be happily moderated through, don't forget
to:

0) write "[ANNOUNCE]", "[ANN]", or "[SECURITY]" in the subject line as
appropriate

1) send the email in PLAINTEXT --all else will be rejected

2) include the appropriate URL for downloading the release or more
information regarding the announcement

3) include the DOAP! Whilst you may know what your project is, there's a
chance that others don't, particularly those with funky names/acronyms.
Hone your message and polish that one-liner!

3a) speaking of DOAP, relationships are nice --does your project
involve/play with other technologies? If so, state the relationship.

4) include a way for folks to learn more. Link to the project home page or
a mailing list or some other relevant resource.

5) personalize your closing --whether your choose to sign off using your
name or (on behalf of) the collective PMC, doing something friendly
reinforces the "community" aspect of the ASF.

 
Thanks so much,
Sally
