2003-03-20 06:53  jmason

2003-03-20 06:51  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: trivial documentation correction

2003-03-19 22:26  msquadrat

	* Makefile.PL: bug 1652: Perl 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 ship different
	versions of ExtUtils::MakeMaker; both carry the version 5.45 though

2003-03-19 19:29  felicity

	* Makefile.PL: bug 1652: the suggested patch doesn't work.  perl
	5.6.0 and perl 5.6.1 both have EU:MM 5.45, but the one in 5.6.1 has
	PM_FILTER.  so reverting the initial patch since it doesn't take
	this into account.

2003-03-19 05:27  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1655: we tie to check # of
	Bayes tokens, but we don't untie if # ham/spam is too low.  fixed.

2003-03-19 04:52  jmason

	* MANIFEST: bug 1541: removed trim_bayes_db from distro

2003-03-19 02:38  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1636: incorrect errors
	from bayes if an error occurred during big scan-counter increment

2003-03-19 01:56  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1626: if a token's atime
	in the bayes db is > current scan count, there was an expiry error,
	so we'll reset the atime to the last expire time.

2003-03-18 23:13  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Conf.pm,
	SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1576: need safer way to render
	attachments for broken clients

2003-03-18 22:52  felicity

	* t/: razor.t, razor2.t: bug 1619: razor tests were failing because
	the rule description changed from what was being tested

2003-03-18 22:11  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1566:
	if spamd is run with -x, spamd only ties the Bayes DBs once, so SA
	doesn't detect when nspam/nham have gone over the min # required
	(200) and enable automatically.

2003-03-18 22:04  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1579: there were several
	undef warnings in the Bayes code.  cleaned that out.

2003-03-18 21:58  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm:
	bug 1556: PerMsgStatus wasn't cleaning up bayes DB ties after it
	was done scanning which caused problems with MailScanner.

2003-03-18 21:55  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: bug 1653: HTML tests had undef
	warnings sometimes.  do better parsing via RE.

2003-03-18 03:27  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1640: spamd was sending the Content-Length
	header instead of the Spam: header for protocol 1.2 clients.  it
	should have been sending just the Spam header, not the
	Content-Length one.

2003-03-18 03:21  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: bug 1648: unwhitelist_from_rcvd
	was non-functional due to typo.  also updated some docs.

2003-03-18 03:14  felicity

	* Makefile.PL: bug 1652: we checked for version < 5.45, but the
	feature was added > 5.45, so we get confused when == 5.45.

2003-03-17 23:56  felicity

	* rules/: 10_misc.cf, 20_anti_ratware.cf, 20_body_tests.cf,
	20_compensate.cf, 20_head_tests.cf, 20_html_tests.cf,

	30_text_pl.cf, 50_scores.cf, 60_whitelist.cf, 70_broken_rules.cf,
	70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf, regression_tests.cf: bug 1607: add
	license information to the rule files

2003-03-17 19:07  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1651: if for some reason a
	Bayes scan() doesn't occur (too few tokens, tokens without enough
	probability, etc,) but the DBs were already tied, we didn't untie
	them.

2003-03-17 15:24  felicity

	* sa-learn.raw, spamassassin.raw, spamd/spamc.pod: bug 1605: SA
	documentation ought to specify what "ham" is for people who don't
	necessarily know it means non-spam.

2003-03-17 15:19  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: fix for
	bug 1591:  Bayes is_available() didn't pay attention to use_bayes,
	so it would still attempt a tie and possibly create DBs even if it
	wasn't going to use the bayes stuff.  renamed the function to
	is_scan_available() since other modules call it to see if a scan
	would be done (determining scoreset, etc.)  cleaned up scan() a
	little (let is_scan_available check for # of tokens)

2003-03-17 15:12  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: fix for bug 1610: after a
	bayes expire, the current message scan count would return to 0. 
	this is because the magic token in the db (scancount_base) wasn't
	being copied over.  oops.  also added checks for return values to
	make sure we don't delete the journal unless we really should. 
	modified expiry_due to do an expire if the last expire time is >
	current message scan.  this should never happen in actual usage and
	only appears if this bug has occured.

2003-03-17 07:25  quinlan

	* debian/: README.Upgrade, changelog.in, copyright,
	spamassassin.README.Debian, spamassassin.docs,

	masses/local-scripts-jm/mass-check-all-mail-archives,
