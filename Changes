	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1869: came up with a
	kluge for the "tokens have 16-bit atime" problem.  if the expire
	code detects that scancount is > 65535, reset all the counters to
	an atime of 0.	it means one expire run doesn't actually expire
	anything, but it should keep the useful tokens around instead of
	the semi-random expire that was occuring in earlier versions.

2003-05-08 17:42  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1860: Bayes was not using
	hapaxes

2003-05-06 09:14  felicity

	* rules/: 20_meta_tests.cf, 50_scores.cf: bug 1589: spammers have
	been targeting our nice rules to get themselves negative overall
	scores.  ran the GA again to lower the nice rule scores.  this
	should help deal with the forgeries.  also added a "TOO_MANY_MUA"
	rule that will catch when multiple USER_AGENT rules hit.

2003-05-02 02:25  jmason

	the subject rewritten, but rewrite_subject is off by default in
	2.5x.  change the docs to reflect this.

2003-04-22 08:00  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1706: fixed a small
	issue where the code was expecting a shift but got a pop, so we
	need to look at the end of the array, not the beginning. :(

2003-04-22 07:54  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1706: when bayes was
	expiring tokens, it would check to see if there were enough tokens
	left at the end and reprieve tokens if necessary.  however, the
	reprieval was happening in a random order, so the oldest tokens
	would likely be left in the DB.  the code will now sort the tokens
	by atime and reprieval the most recently used tokens first.

2003-04-19 15:35  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1800: messages with
	large positive scores (if they hit GTUBE at 1000 points for
	instance), can have a X-Spam-Level header with more than the RFC
	allowed number of chars.  so we now limit X-Spam-Level to show a
	max score of 100.  that makes it obvious the message is really spam
	while staying RFC compliant.

2003-04-10 11:27  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: bug 1524: EvalTests looking
	for/storing IPs would sometimes catch extra chars that occur around
	the IP address (such as [ in Received headers).  Use a new regexp
	to only match IP addresses.

2003-04-06 21:29  felicity

2003-04-05 14:36  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm: bug 1691: sa-learn was sending

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, t/SATest.pm, t/rule_tests.t,
	t/zz_cleanup.t: bug 1703: Makefile.PL would set a razor1 test if
	razor1 wasn't installed.  rule_tests.t was still trying to use
	bytes.pm.  spamd tests were using user's preferences/bayes/etc.

2003-03-29 20:28  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1707: When syncing the
	journal, the code took advantage of a UNIX-ism where you can open a
	file, then rename it, and still access the file data. 
	Unfortunately, Windows doesn't let you do that.  So we now rename
	before we open, and add a "can we read the file" check beforehand
	to avoid messy cleanup.

2003-03-29 20:10  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1699: a slight change to the

	* MANIFEST, spamd/libspamc.c, spamd/libspamc.h, t/spamc_B.t,

2003-03-28 15:26  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1699:
	slightly better regex.	ignore actual magic token strings, not just
	magic token prefixes.  this leaves more tokens able to be used.

2003-03-28 15:14  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: Bug 1699: The
	code wasn't protecting the Bayes DB "magic" tokens (tracks num
	ham/spam, etc.) from being overwritten if they occured in a
	message.  This allows mails to corrupt the DB either maliciously or
	if they discuss the tokens.

	removed in 2.5x but still was in the POD docs and a test config.

2003-03-27 22:16  felicity

	* sa-learn.raw: bug 1502: sa-learn wasn't paying attention to the
	compile-time paths for rules and the like.  The problem was that

	packages.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: bug 1401: check_rbl was
	checking incorrect number of Received hdrs

2003-03-27 15:35  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: bug 1632: Razor
	modifies %ENV so we tried to use a local() to make a temp version,
	which works, but kills %ENV for the Razor code as well.  So now
	we'll let the helper_mode functions handle backing up/restoring
	%ENV as appropriate.

2003-03-27 12:55  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 1514: spamd was trying to use "../lib" which
	is ok most of the time, but during a "make test" on perl 5.005 it
	errored out with the "bytes.pm" error.	so we now check for a
	"../blib/lib" first and use it if it exists.  otherwise, we
	continue with "../lib".

2003-03-27 12:48  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: bug 1685: we should clean PATH when we
	start if we're in taint mode.  This fixes a Sys::Hostname problem
	in 5.005, but it's a good idea anyway since we won't be able to use
	PATH unless it's cleaned in taint mode anyway.

2003-03-26 20:53  jmason

2003-03-23 20:10  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1664: the
	only entries in the bayes journal are token access time updates
	(from scans).  we can exploit the fact that most of the tokens
	appear multiple times by caching in memory the updates per token,
	then just writing to db the end result times for all tokens.  
	also, scan() tries to opportunistically do a journal sync and
	expire which causes lots of contention if there is a lot of
	messages for a single db (this is usually seen with site-wide dbs).
	 so we flag when we are doing the sync and expire and let all other
	pids not be so opportunistic.  this should greatly lower
	contention.  we also let the db tie r/w happen before we try to
	read from the journal, and also exploit the fact we can open the
	journal before renaming it so the most common error occurs first,
	and then a journal read failure means we don't need to rename the
	temp file back.

2003-03-23 19:52  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1672: a typo in a backported

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: bug 1651: if for some reason a
	Bayes scan() doesn't occur (too few tokens, tokens without enough
	probability, etc,) but the DBs were already tied, we didn't untie
	them.

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: fix for
	bug 1591:  Bayes is_available() didn't pay attention to use_bayes,
	so it would still attempt a tie and possibly create DBs even if it
	wasn't going to use the bayes stuff.  renamed the function to
	is_scan_available() since other modules call it to see if a scan
	would be done (determining scoreset, etc.)  cleaned up scan() a
	little (let is_scan_available check for # of tokens)

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: fix for bug 1610: after a
	bayes expire, the current message scan count would return to 0. 
	this is because the magic token in the db (scancount_base) wasn't
	being copied over.  oops.  also added checks for return values to
	make sure we don't delete the journal unless we really should. 
	modified expiry_due to do an expire if the last expire time is >
	current message scan.  this should never happen in actual usage and
	only appears if this bug has occured.
