	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Added code to do Razor2 'cf'
	(confidence) range checking.  I'm not sure exactly how it'll
	interact with RAZOR2_CHECK since that should take into account the
	user's min_cf setting, but ...
	
	Remove some useless $fulltext stuff w/ Razor1 and 2 as well (why
	set the variable if you're not going to use it?)
	
	For a random 10 spam sample that I received today:
	
	      8 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_90_100
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_80_89
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_00_09
	
	So 80% had a super confidence level, 10% was very high, and 10% was
	very low.
	
	The default for users, BTW, is a min_cf setting of 1.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, masses/mass-check:
	nonsense_from_percent() returned "true" if the names-triplets.txt
	file couldn't be found which is the same as "rule matches".  Change
	it to return "false" instead so we don't FP if we can't read the
	file.
	
	nonsense_from_percent() used rules_filename which isn't likely to
	be set in an actual run.  Converted it to use DEF_RULES_DIR and
	LOCAL_RULES_DIR like the other EvalTests since it's guaranteed to
	be set.
	
	mass-check wasn't setting DEF_RULES_DIR and LOCAL_RULES_DIR (and
	PREFIX) which breaks EvalTests...

	as well

2002-10-16 01:21  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: Razor2 calls
	Net::Ping which uses alarm() to timeout.  Unfortunately that kills
	our timeout alarm() for the Razor2 calls.  Doh!  Added in alarms
	after the get_server_info() call (the one that calls Net::Ping) to
	reset our timeout.  It's not great, but I think it'll stop the
	"razor check/report hangs" type problem.

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: I have mailman subscription
	reminders that get flagged with 6-8 points.  This rule should match
	these mails and give it a nice strong negative score.  If we're
	worried about it being abused (since it's a From && Subject rule),
	I can add a body piece pretty easily since there's a standard
	section.  It seemed overkill at the moment.

	addresses.

2002-10-01 21:33  jmason

	* spamd/spamd.raw: no longer notes kids pid in REAPER, in line with

2002-10-01 21:28  jmason

	* spamproxy/spamproxyd.raw: Patched spamproxyd.raw to specify a
	maximum message size.  The patch and new version wasn't very
	different but the whitespace was all changed around, so it looked
	like a lot more work.  Since so much had been changed already, I
	ran the resulting code through "perltidy -i=2".
	
	I also modified the code to be a bit more efficient:	- instead
	of doing a split(/\r\n/) then adding the \r\n back in,		I
	changed it to split(/^/).   - Code around if/else statements were
	duplicated, so I rewrote	    it to only run the code once.

	ported.
	Solves the same "{dccproc,pyzor}: command not found" bug when
	people use "spamassassin -r".	- {dcc,pyzor}_report now users
	{dcc,pyzor}_timeout and the configured	{dcc,pyzor}_path instead of
	`{dccproc,pyzor}`  - Minor indentation issue in Reporter.pm  -
	Razor2 reporting now returns a valid return code  -
	{dcc,pyzor}_report should not do open2

2002-09-27 21:40  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: 
	Patch for bug 901.

	  not displaying anything.  When code is available, will display
	path to tools instead of nothing.

	user that hasn't upgraded yet.
