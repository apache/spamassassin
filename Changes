	learn-to-journal a restricted command.	also move some of the other
	options around to make the flow better in the documentation.

2003-06-30 02:27  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/CmdLearn.pm, SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: bug 2154: 1)
	sa-learn called init, which called init_learner with the config
	options.  for me, this enabled learn to journal.      cmdlearn then
	called init_learner with the appropriate options for forget (don't
	learn to journal), except that init_learner only can enable, not
	disable options.  so we always learned to the journal.	see #2.
	
	2) during a forget (which can be called when we're learning an
	already learned message as a different type as well), we didn't
	update the journal.
	
	3) auto_learn_journal is a minomer since all learning goes to the
	journal.
	
	so: we now allow init_learner to enable or disable options
	depending on true/false values, we rename auto_learn_to_journal to
	just be learn_to_journal, and forget now will update the journal if
	necessary.

2003-06-12 01:53  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: bug 2043: quoted directly from the bug:
	
	When spamd is run with --ssl, if it receives a connection that does
	not successfully negotiate SSL then _all_ the spamd processes quit.
	
	The block starting on line 481 of spamd.raw wants to figure out why
	the accept() call did not succeed. In the non-SSL world, !$client
	is true only where an OS error happened. However, in the SSL world,
	!$client can also happen where the SSL negotiation failed, which
	does not imply an OS error and the consequent setting of errno.
	
	The attached patch detects this; if SSL is set and errno is zero,
	then we log the fact that there must've been an SSL error, and we
	don't allow ourselves to be die()d.

2003-05-11 01:29  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1888: the expiry system
	tries to figure out if the new expire is largely different from the
	last expire.  if they are, there was probably a surge at some point
	and it would make a bad estimation for this expire, so it'll
	recompute atime delta.	but 0 is a valid last expire count (new
	db), so we got a div by zero error. :(
	
	changed expiry_due to check for >100000 tokens.  if there were
	exactly 100k tokens, and we did the expire, it would get confused
	because to leave 100k tokens in the db (safety), we would want to
	remove 0 tokens.
	
	if we couldn't find a good exponent to expire from in the first
	pass, we'd return without removing the expiry_running flag.  it
	would eventually time out, but if we know we're not expiring
	anymore, we should remove it.
	
	had a stupid bug where expiry would expire to 100000 if it wanted
	to keep more than 100k tokens.	teaches you to use the correct <>
	symbol. ;) (it now says keep 100k if the "to expire to" point is <
	100k, which is the correct logic...)
	
	added a "need to do first pass" check if the last expire count is
	0.  whenever that happens, last atime delta should also be 0, and
	that's already checked, but ...

	bug 1881: we will now learn to the journal instead of requiring the
	db to be r/w.  however, msgids (the seen db) weren't updated by
	journal learning.  added code to support learning and forgetting
	(but don't do that, the code is actually disabled to forget to
	journal).
	
	bug 1821: we decided on a new bayes format again.  this time it's
	token atime is based on message received time.	this brought up a
	whole bunch of issues, but mostly required new pack/unpack,
	upgrade_db, expire, and a bunch of other changes.  while I was
	milling about I fixed a few other random bugs.	I don't quite

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bugs 1523, 1666,
	1775, and 1776: set a new bayes db format for 2.6x, version 1 (2.5x
	had version 0).  atimes are now unsigned ints (32-bit) instead of a
	short (16-bit) so we won't get overflow/expire issues.	code is now
	included to automatically upgrade to v1 when the db is opened for
	writing.  v0 is still supported for readonly mode.  bayes tokens
	are now packed in little-endian (VAX) format.  this means that the
	same DB will work on different endian platforms.
	
	at the moment, r/w access to the bayes db has been disabled pending
	final resolution of bug 1776 and the "should atime be message count
	or timestamp" question.  right now, the code assumes message count.

2003-04-22 12:54  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: bug 1706: when bayes was
	expiring tokens, it would check to see if there were enough tokens
	left at the end and reprieve tokens if necessary.  however, the
	reprieval was happening in a random order, so the oldest tokens
	would likely be left in the DB.  the code will now sort the tokens
	by atime and reprieval the most recently used tokens first.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm: bug 1664: the
	only entries in the bayes journal are token access time updates
	(from scans).  we can exploit the fact that most of the tokens
	appear multiple times by caching in memory the updates per token,
	then just writing to db the end result times for all tokens.  
	also, scan() tries to opportunistically do a journal sync and
	expire which causes lots of contention if there is a lot of
	messages for a single db (this is usually seen with site-wide dbs).
	 so we flag when we are doing the sync and expire and let all other
	pids not be so opportunistic.  this should greatly lower
	contention.  we also let the db tie r/w happen before we try to
	read from the journal, and also exploit the fact we can open the
	journal before renaming it so the most common error occurs first,
	and then a journal read failure means we don't need to rename the
	temp file back.

	so it would still attempt a tie and possibly create DBs even if it
	wasn't going to use the bayes stuff.  renamed the function to
	is_scan_available() since other modules call it to see if a scan
	would be done (determining scoreset, etc.)  cleaned up scan() a
	little (let is_scan_available check for # of tokens)

	this is because the magic token in the db (scancount_base) wasn't
	being copied over.  oops.  also added checks for return values to
	make sure we don't delete the journal unless we really should. 
	modified expiry_due to do an expire if the last expire time is >
	current message scan.  this should never happen in actual usage and

2003-03-07 06:03  quinlan

	* masses/mass-check: bug 1596: make progress bar optional in
	mass-check

2003-03-07 06:01  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: bug 1261: add T_BASE64_ENC_TEXT
	new T_MIME_BASE64_* tests possible replacements for ADVERT_CODE and
	ADVERT_CODE2

2003-03-07 06:00  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: tweaks to
	T_MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA_* new T_MIME_BASE64_* tests always test MIME
	headers in message header (big improvement for
	MIME_HTML_NO_CHARSET)

2003-03-06 23:01  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: standardize the "incorrect
	data, not just a number" check with the others. :)

2003-03-06 22:34  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: BayesStore.pm, CmdLearn.pm: Fix for bug
	1611, we ought to update the token count. ;) I also noticed that
	sa-learn wasn't taking an argument for -D so you couldn't get
	detailed debug info. :(

2003-03-06 02:37  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: we should return if we can't
	open instead of just warning and continuing

2003-03-05 21:43  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: 2 new rules.  HTML mail should
	have a HTML and BODY tag.

2003-03-05 18:48  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: fix for bug 1604.  do a setgid() when we do the
	setuid().

2003-03-05 18:22  felicity

	* sa-learn.raw, spamassassin.raw, spamd/spamc.pod: some small doc
	changes for bug 1605.  we should use "ham" everywhere, and we
	should specify in each doc file that "ham means non-spam".

2003-03-04 19:11  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: added a check for
	UNUSABLE_MSGID in the T_FORGED_MUA rules

2003-03-04 16:11  felicity

	* spamd/spamd.raw: Cleaned up the documentation about --username a
	little to make it (hopefully) very obvious that setting
	"--username" disables the setuid() functionality in the code, even
	if the specified username is "root".

2003-03-04 09:15  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Util.pm: use a hash for month mappings to
	avoid repeating work

2003-03-04 08:37  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: test some faster revisions for
	six slow rules add some rawbody T_REMOVE_REMOVAL_* variants bug
	821: test for "good" RFC2369 headers (final attempt at this idea,
	we hope)

2003-03-04 04:05  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: Updated a few
	debug statements

2003-03-03 22:21  felicity

	* spamassassin.spec: fix for bug 1593 apparently sometimes
	MakeMaker and RPM have a disagreement about where they think the
	man pages should be, and our previous kluge for INSTALLMAN1DIR
	wasn't actually doing anything since "make install" uses
	INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR.  So this patch forces all 3 different man paths
	to be the same as RPM is expecting.

2003-03-03 19:58  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Fix for
	bug 1591.  renamed Bayes::is_available to Bayes::is_scan_available
	since it's specifically geared towards scan() (can I tie the DB,
	and are there enough tokens?)  cleaned up scan() a little to just
	call is_scan_available (checked to tie the DB, enough tokens, etc.)

2003-03-03 19:07  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Don't run eval rules from
	the wrong scoreset.  ie: don't run tflag learn rules unless
	scoreset&2 is set, and don't run tflag net rules unless scoreset&1
	is set.  This way we don't need each eval code to check for
	local_tests_only and the like.

2003-03-03 18:47  jmason

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: some more T_ rules for a new

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: meta subrule got renamed test
	rules should start with a T_

2003-03-02 13:20  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: add code for
	T_NO_DNS_FOR_RECIPS_* to detect cases where one or more addresses
	in recipient list do not have DNS records (meaning they are likely
	to be old addresses in spammer databases) also add some code to
	better support qmail for T_MSG_ID_ADDED_BY_MTA_*

2003-03-02 13:17  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: add T_NO_DNS_FOR_RECIPS_* add
	T_REMOVE_REMOVALS_*

2003-02-28 22:22  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: test rules to look for RFC2822 "#
	of header" violations, also look for multiple Content-Type and
	Content-Transfer-Encoding headers which shouldn't exist in ham.

2003-02-28 20:33  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm, rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf:
	Added two new comment rules.  Work well for me. :)

	and MailScanner -- sa was killing MailScanner due to lack of bayes
	untieing, it seems.

2003-02-28 18:34  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, BayesStore.pm, UnixLocker.pm,

2003-02-27 20:05  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Bayes.pm, Conf.pm: Made minimum ham/spam
	corpus size for bayes a configurable item.  As a side tangent, I
	added 'conf' to Bayes so the individual subs don't need to look for
	$self->{main}->{conf} ...

2003-02-27 14:49  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: more anti-forging work

2003-02-27 11:11  msquadrat

2003-02-27 05:37  duncf

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: Ummm.... sorry, I guess I just
	fixed this for Debian (This has been in my Debian source tree for a
	while, and I guess I just never committed it to CVS)

2003-02-27 04:19  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: trying to strengthen the
	anti-ratware rules more work to come hopefully. :)

2003-02-26 17:35  felicity

	attachment)

2003-02-26 05:23  zelgadis

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Bug #1551: Standards
	violating comment obfuscation

2003-02-26 03:45  felicity

	as the original. :)

2003-02-25 21:47  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/NoMailAudit.pm: ok, now this better be the
	last time...

2003-02-25 21:02  quinlan

2003-02-25 19:28  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EncappedMessage.pm,
	masses/rewrite-cf-with-new-scores, masses/score-ranges-from-freqs:
	Kluge for bug 1558.  It's really bugginess in RPM 4.1, but at the
	moment it's easier to work around their issue then to explain to
	all the users why it's RPM's fault, so that's why the SA RPM
	doesn't build right.

2003-02-25 15:36  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: add a few more
	T_HTML_NO_DOCTYPE variants

2003-02-24 03:18  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/NoMailAudit.pm: fix for bug 1544.  add
	option to _get_header_list to retrieve header names that match case
	insensitively instead of just returning the values from all of
	those same headers.  instead of replace_header seeing if there are
	versions that need to be removed, just call delete_header and it'll
	figure it out.	delete_header now removes all case insensitive
	matches (via _get_header_list) of a header instead of the case
	sensitive match.  according to rfc2822, header names are case
	insensitive so we should deal with that appropriately.

2003-02-24 00:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: When looking at Bayes in
	scoreset, look for bit 2 instead of lt/gt/%/etc.

2003-02-23 23:46  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: one test should have been a
	meta, not a header.  __INVALID_DATE is missing a paren in the RE. 
	it's so complex, I didn't want to try figuring out where to put the
	')'...	disabled for now.

2003-02-23 20:46  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm,
	SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: during bayes expiry, we should call
	sync() instead of the individual BayesStore functions.	added new
	"bayes" debug type.  added some bayes debug statements around
	expiry.

2003-02-18 17:47  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/BayesStore.pm: All of the bayes_* files
	ought to have the same file permissions, so we need to do a chmod

2003-02-17 08:15  felicity

	restrictive

2003-02-16 07:39  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Headers that should be

	tools/check_bayes_db: bug 1460: bayes_expiry_use_scan_count is now
	the default, using a method that should not be much slower than
	using the time.  This now means that expiry can take place during a
	mass-check, which is very important.  Implementation uses a
	separate file, bayes_msgcount, to track scan-count.  This will not
	require rescanning the bayes dbs.

2003-02-14 21:10  felicity

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: Fixed up the
	dcc/pyzor debugging statements

	working on a fix for bug 1447 I found that it was just easier to

	some code directly in dns to avoid the "one gets updated without
	the other one" problem we keep having...  Report and check are
	still seperate, but the *_available code is now the same.  Reporter
	also does helper_mode now (which fixed the tainted path issue).
	
	I've tested against razor and dcc and they seem to work fine.  I
	don't have pyzor installed, but since dcc works I don't see why

	So now I reverted to the code that did work, tested it, and am now
	committing it.	Somebody please slap me around for doing this ...

2003-02-06 16:25  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Fixes bug 1451.  If Bayes

2003-01-23 00:58  jmason

	* spamd/: libspamc.c, libspamc.h, spamc.c, utils.c, utils.h: bug

2003-01-22 14:35  jmason

	* spamd/libspamc.c: reworked the failover-fix code a little to
	avoid coredump reported by Malte

2003-01-21 22:15  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: Fix for bug
	1400.  If a rule was defined with no score, only a single scoreset
	would get a score set for it.  We now set a score for all scoresets
	unless one is currently defined.  Changed the autolearn code back
	to not checking for existence.

2003-01-21 21:48  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: For some stupid reason,
	scoresets may have different rules from each other, so we need to
	check for existence. :(

2003-01-21 21:02  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Bayes.pm: give debug info if we can't use a
	bayes db due to insufficient messages

2003-01-21 19:38  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: always_add_report should be 0, not
	1 by default

2003-01-21 19:36  felicity

	* rules/23_bayes.cf: a bunch of BAYES rules didn't have tflags
	learn ...

2003-01-21 18:44  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: let autolearn ignore
	userconf too

2003-01-21 18:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Code skips 0 score sets in
	autolearning We now ignore tflag "learn" rules in autolearning
	instead of /BAYES/

2003-01-21 17:57  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: leftover crud. sorry
	about that

2003-01-21 17:33  jmason

	* sa-learn-nonspam.raw, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm,
	lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm,
	lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm,
	masses/corpora/mass-find-nonspam: added always_add_report param,
	patch from sabat (sabat /at/ eloan /dot/ com)

2003-01-21 16:09  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: autolearning
	will now only take place with scoresets 0 and 1.  if we're using 2
	or 3, the autolearn code will revert to 0 or 1 and recompute the
	score, then check about autolearning.  this gives us consistency in
	autolearning on the same scoresets all the time.

2003-01-21 15:13  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: Updated scores after set1 run

2003-01-21 01:55  felicity

2003-01-21 01:36  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs, rules/20_head_tests.cf:
	fixing some stuff to remove tests, X_OSIRU_DUL_FH is supposed to be
	nice

2003-01-20 19:54  felicity

	* masses/: hit-frequencies, lint-rules-from-freqs: More work to
	make net tests mutable if we're doing a net test (scoreset%2 == 1)

2003-01-20 19:40  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: GA set0 scores > 4.8 brought down to 4.0
	(except those that are very unlikely to FP)

2003-01-20 19:28  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: GA scored set 0

2003-01-20 19:05  jmason

	* spamd/libspamc.c: struct hostent was overwritten in syslog call
	so failover was not working; now fixed, I think

2003-01-20 18:52  felicity

	* masses/Makefile: Makefile now knows about scoresets.	Do a "make
	SCORESET=#" or it'll default to 0.

2003-01-20 18:46  felicity

	* masses/logs-to-c: put back includes, lets evolve compile on
	macosx. :(

2003-01-20 16:50  felicity

	* masses/score-ranges-from-freqs: make net tests mutable if
	scoreset indicates a net run

2003-01-20 15:49  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, masses/hit-frequencies,
	masses/logs-to-c, masses/parse-rules-for-masses,
	masses/score-ranges-from-freqs: Comment out CARRIAGE_RETURN eval
	code.  masses code now understands scoresets, at least enough. :)

2003-01-20 01:47  felicity

	* rules/: 20_body_tests.cf, 30_text_fr.cf, 50_scores.cf,
	70_broken_rules.cf: got rid of CARRIAGE_RETURNS

2003-01-19 20:23  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: fixed a few more bugs

2003-01-19 19:50  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: fixed the code some more
	to deal with -t option

2003-01-19 17:28  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: boo boo with HABEAS_SWE

2003-01-19 05:59  felicity

	* masses/corpora/remove-tests-from-logs: take a -t option to
	specify a timestamp.  rule removal will only happen up to that
	timestamp.  this is useful for net tests where you only want to
	keep X months.

2003-01-19 05:20  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: total_check wasn't being incremented before
	progress, so at 100% done, we were one off. :(

2003-01-19 04:25  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: BayesStore.pm, Conf.pm,
	DBBasedAddrList.pm, NoMailAudit.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm, Util.pm: Put
	umask around any open or tie commands.	This will 1) let the *_mode
	options work as expected, and 2) keep some of our temp files more
	secure.

2003-01-19 00:56  felicity

	* masses/score-ranges-from-freqs: it didn't know how to deal with
	multiple scoresets, so I let it default to set0

2003-01-19 00:41  felicity

	* rules/: 20_compensate.cf, 20_head_tests.cf, 20_phrases.cf,
	20_ratware.cf, 20_uri_tests.cf, 50_scores.cf, 70_broken_rules.cf:
	pushed rules to 70_broken from the first 2.50 mass-check with bad
	results.

2003-01-18 22:40  felicity

	* rules/20_compensate.cf: [no log message]

2003-01-18 20:58  felicity

	* rules/: 20_meta_tests.cf, 20_phrases.cf: NMS_CGI_NOT_BUGGY wasn't
	hitting anything, so I made it part of a meta rule with BUGGY_CGI
	per suggestion from eallen.

2003-01-18 16:51  felicity

	* masses/: craig-evolve.c, logs-to-c: Applied Allen's GA patches
	from bug 1088.

	coming for 2.60)

2003-01-18 06:19  felicity

	* masses/hit-frequencies: hit-frequencies doesn't know what to do
	with multiple scoresets, so I let it default to scoreset 0...

2003-01-18 06:08  felicity

	* rules/50_scores.cf: setting pre-GA scores for bayes and net tests

2003-01-17 01:45  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: $date is passed undef to progress, so I added
	in a "set to 0 if undefined" to at least stop the warning. 
	$total_count is set to 0 in the parent, then each child increases
	their copy, then the parent calls progress which still sees
	$total_count==0.  So I moved the increment into the parent.

2003-01-16 20:28  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: added a debug statement in case the
	object format changes incompatibly again

2003-01-16 20:22  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, EvalTests.pm: Fixed up Razor2
	check code some more.  We now support both razor object layouts
	(<2.14 and >=2.14).  Got rid of extra variable in Razor2 code. 
	Fixed comment for SEMIFORGED_HOTMAIL_RCVD.

2003-01-16 16:10  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: mass-check now shows status every $updates
	messages and at 100%

2003-01-16 14:42  felicity

	* masses/mass-check: fixed status displays to not give "illegal
	modulus 0" errors on small checks.

2003-01-16 12:06  msquadrat

	* masses/mass-check: Some tweaks to the --mid code (again): Make
	the mid meta RE safe and remove the time part (we don't need to
	create unique MIDs, this is just for logging)

2003-01-16 08:07  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: remove comment

2003-01-16 07:55  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm, masses/mass-check: fix
	mass-check progress indicator fix mid so it will be consistent

2003-01-16 07:04  climent

	* rules/25_body_tests_es.cf: New entry

2003-01-15 20:43  jmason

	of INVALID_MSGID (one was promoted)

2003-01-01 09:30  quinlan

	discussion on sa lists

2002-12-31 19:37  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: parse eval options at
	parse time instead of run-time (5.5% speed-up)

2002-12-31 19:37  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Conf.pm: change test types to constants
	(odd-numbered ones are now evals too) change some '-' characters in
	option names to '_' characters to be more consistent parse eval
	options at parse time instead of run-time (5.5% speed-up) reorder
	if/elsif during finish_parsing a bit for somewhat better speed
	(order by frequency of test, probably not a noticeable difference)
	use tr// in two places instead of s//

2002-12-31 19:31  quinlan

	* rules/10_misc.cf: change some '-' characters to be '_' for better

	for the option word separator)

2002-12-30 14:36  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: Found more "close
	STDIN" statements with the next call too -- replaced as per last
	commit.

2002-12-30 14:34  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/ArchiveIterator.pm: Fix for bug 1325, we
	don't need to close STDIN so don't. ;) Also, there's a next call
	where there's no context for a next, so perl (5.8.0 at least)
	treats it as a return, so just call return.

2002-12-30 06:08  quinlan

	* rules/20_html_tests.cf: remove HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_14

2002-12-30 01:40  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: the razor2 problem seemed to be
	related to having a dos formatted file.  razor-check doesn't seem
	to have any issues checking it, but through spamassassin, razor
	would see 1 big header.  the solution is to replace the lf/cr/lf
	combo with just lf/lf.	That makes the blank line between header
	and body blank, and razor works nicely for SA then.

2002-12-30 01:15  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: There seem to be sometimes where
	Razor2 doesn't think it gets a request, and therefore doesn't set
	'spam' properly leading to an undefined warning further down the
	code.  Until I can track down the problem, I've put in a kluge
	which basically just sets the result to 0 if it's undefined.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm, rules/20_body_tests.cf,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: generalize most of the
	check_for_mime tests (most of the functions are not needed) add
	T_MIME_DEFICIENT_QP rule (rule I had discarded earlier because it
	did not work well, but should work better now that the MIME QP code
	has been improved, it's also only a few lines of code now) also
	organize the MIME rules a bit

2002-12-29 00:08  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Per bug 1316, it looks like
	mutt has a standard format to message-id.  I added a test meta rule
	to look for both the user-agent and message-id headers for
	USER_AGENT.  Also added a forged_mua rule to look for user-agent
	without message-id.  This doesn't score so well, but...

	* rules/: 20_body_tests.cf, 20_head_tests.cf, 20_uri_tests.cf,

2002-12-28 19:13  felicity

	* rules/: 20_anti_ratware.cf, 20_compensate.cf,
	70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: Added a T_FAKE_USER_AGENT that goes off

2002-12-27 03:17  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Reworked code of do_meta
	so that meta rules can depend on other meta rules.  The code will
	figure out the dependencies and run the metas in the right order. 
	If a dependency on another meta rule can't be solved (ie: circular
	dependency), the rule is skipped and a debug message is displayed
	(if debugging is enabled).
	
	So: meta BB AA && CC meta AA HEAD1 && CC meta CC HEAD2
	
	Although contrived, the code will make sure to run CC, then AA,
	then BB.
	
	However: meta AA BB meta BB AA
	
	Causes both rules to be skipped.

2002-12-26 23:24  felicity

2002-12-26 10:18  quinlan

	T_ rules - try version of T_BODY_QUOTES test without any single
	quotes - remove rules specific to easmith and quinlan (these were

	of hits for this test (the same exact FP problem seems to affect
	SUSPICIOUS_RECIPS) also add T_SORTED_RECIPIENTS test for testing

2002-12-24 04:29  felicity

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: bug 786: DEAR_SOMEBODY and

	replacement meta rule to see if we can clear it up.  DEAR_SOMEBODY
	has a fairly bad S/O rating anyway, so we may just end up removing

	WEIRD_PORT hits
	http://www.cnn.com:USArticle1840@www.liquidshirts.com/ which
	actually doesn't have a port specified in it.  Put in a possible

	* lib/Mail/: SpamAssassin.pm, SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Thought
	of a new solution to the bayes getting false message-id during
	encapsulated reporting and such -- take the message-id and put it
	in the encapsulated header.  The correct message-id will be used,
	and then pre-learning the message is cleaned as before.

	avoiding my fps

2002-12-23 14:09  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Use a private variable to
	set content-description for the mime encapsulated section.  Didn't
	go with my previous commit for some reason. :(

2002-12-23 14:08  felicity

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: If you change the content-type or
	content-description of the mime encapsulated spam mail part, you
	need to change it in remove_spamassassin_markup as well.  We don't
	have any other tell-tale markup saying it's an encapsulated
	message, so the code keys in on the two content-* headers.
	
	Added a private configuration setting in SpamAssassin.pm which lets
	us change the description in one place and have it used in
	(de)encapsulation.

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: Modified Dns.pm to error out of PTR
	and MX DNS lookups more nicely, ala bug 1270.  Net::DNS sometimes
	dies horribly (if the nameserver(s) listed in resolv.conf don't
	work, for instance,) so is_dns_available will now deal with this
	situation in conjunction with lookup_mx.  lookup_ptr (used by an
	EvalTest) just returns undef which is already an understood return
	value.

	(confidence) range checking.  I'm not sure exactly how it'll
	interact with RAZOR2_CHECK since that should take into account the
	user's min_cf setting, but ...
	
	Remove some useless $fulltext stuff w/ Razor1 and 2 as well (why
	set the variable if you're not going to use it?)
	
	For a random 10 spam sample that I received today:
	
	      8 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_90_100
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_80_89
	      1 T_RAZOR2_RANGE_00_09
	
	So 80% had a super confidence level, 10% was very high, and 10% was
	very low.
	
	The default for users, BTW, is a min_cf setting of 1.

	nonsense_from_percent() used rules_filename which isn't likely to
	be set in an actual run.  Converted it to use DEF_RULES_DIR and
	LOCAL_RULES_DIR like the other EvalTests since it's guaranteed to
	be set.
	
	mass-check wasn't setting DEF_RULES_DIR and LOCAL_RULES_DIR (and

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Dns.pm, Reporter.pm: Razor2 calls
	Net::Ping which uses alarm() to timeout.  Unfortunately that kills
	our timeout alarm() for the Razor2 calls.  Doh!  Added in alarms
	after the get_server_info() call (the one that calls Net::Ping) to

	ran the resulting code through "perltidy -i=2".
	
	I also modified the code to be a bit more efficient:	- instead
	of doing a split(/\r\n/) then adding the \r\n back in,		I
	changed it to split(/^/).   - Code around if/else statements were
	duplicated, so I rewrote	    it to only run the code once.

2002-09-25 00:31  jmason

	* README: fixed README

	* t/whitelist_addrs.t: file whitelist_addrs.t was initially added
	on branch b2_4_0.

2002-09-24 19:51  jmason

	* MANIFEST, Makefile.PL, spamassassin.raw,
	lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/AutoWhitelist.pm,
	lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm, spamd/spamd.raw,
	t/db_based_whitelist.t, t/db_based_whitelist_ips.t,
	t/whitelist_addrs.t: fixed whitelist bugs: 894 (mailto:s in Outlook

	847: search for rules failed if PREFIX was not /usr. fixed debian
	bug 159704: AWL was storing post-AWL scores, hence reinforcing
	itself wrongly.  also added code to allow AWL to 'decay' scores
	again, since forged-froms are no longer such a problem

2002-09-24 18:12  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: removed alt-tag and spacer-gif
	tests again, they got lousy S/Os

2002-09-24 18:10  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm: minor speedup for check_message_text()
	fn from Rob Nagler

2002-09-24 18:00  jmason

	unlikely to appear in HTML spam; removed Subject: prefix from
	subject line added to body, as it's not needed

2002-09-24 11:00  jmason

	* spamd/spamd.raw: spamd syslog code now tries unix before failover
	to inet; cleanupchildren re-added to REAPER

2002-09-24 10:54  jmason

	* spamd/spamd.raw: readded cleanupchildren call to REAPER

2002-09-24 02:35  duncf

	* spamd/spamd.raw: Fixes 1011 and 1016: Makes REAPER actually do
	something.  Copied the code from cleanupchildren into REAPER (don't
	want to call cleanupchildren from REAPER -- may cause problems on
	perl < 5.7.3) and commented out dbg line, since that's probably not
	safe either.

2002-09-23 18:44  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm,

2002-09-23 11:13  zelgadis

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm, rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf:
	Bug #1018: Proposed TITLE tag rules

2002-09-23 03:13  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug 1015: quoted-printable
	decoding bug

2002-09-22 14:30  jmason

	* rules/: 20_head_tests.cf, 50_scores.cf,
	70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: upgraded AZOOGLE test

2002-09-22 06:05  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm: consolidate IP address
	regular expressions (new $IP_ADDRESS variable) MIME_EXCESSIVE_QP:
	lowercase [a-f] are not part of QP

2002-09-22 00:29  jmason

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: removed FROM_HAS_LOTSA_NUMS
	tests, none of them get good freqs

2002-09-21 14:40  jmason

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: changed T_FROM_HAS_LOTSA_NUMS
	patterns to avoid fping on TMDA messages; added more tests to
	T_FROM_HAS_LOTSA_NUMS collection

2002-09-21 13:25  quinlan

	response

2002-09-21 04:53  duncf

	* spamd/libspamc.c: Fixes potential overflow -- Debian 160206

2002-09-21 04:48  duncf

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm: This should hopefully fix Debian
	bug 161696 -- memory leak in network check code. I assumed this was
	due to sockets not getting closed. I wonder if running DNS queries
	in the background that may never be checked is a good thing.

2002-09-20 21:31  quinlan

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: remove low-performing rules
	(T_EASY_MONEY and T_MIME_BOUND_MULTIPART)

	masses/mass-check-results-to-mbox,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: added azoogle.com test, added
	T_FROM_HAS_LOTSA_NUMS tests; made auto-whitelisting gradually lower
	the score, since we now track IP addresses, so forged-From spams do
	not need to be compensated against.

2002-09-20 17:43  jmason

	* build/cf_to_html, lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/EvalTests.pm,

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: bug 987: add back fixed

	* rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: add experimental T_MIME_BOUND
	tests

2002-09-19 23:33  quinlan

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: bug #905: spamassassin
	headers not removed correctly (this patch removes
	X-Spam-Prev-Content-Transfer-Encoding and X-Spam-Prev-Content-Type,
	but only after writing their values back into the original header).

2002-09-19 16:26  jmason

	use lang=en descs where possible

2002-09-19 11:20  jmason

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm,
	rules/70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: fixed typos in earthlink meta
	test; fixed warnings-off hack in meta tests which breaks on perl
	5.6.1

2002-09-19 09:54  matt_sergeant

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm: Removed 'warnings' pragma

2002-09-19 07:58  quinlan

	* rules/: 20_compensate.cf, 50_scores.cf,
	70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf: bug #991: add REPLY_WITH_QUOTES rule
	using new meta math, lower scores for a few of the component rules
	to avoid extra FNs

2002-09-19 02:58  zelgadis

	* lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/: Conf.pm, PerMsgStatus.pm: Bug #995: Allow

	MIME_EXCESSIVE_QP to only count characters that should not be
