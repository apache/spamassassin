SPAMASSASSIN DEVELOPMENT SNAPSHOT PROCEDURE
===========================================

- cd to the directory for the codebase you want the devel tree to
  come from

    ssh minotaur.apache.org
    cd [checkedoutdir]

- ensure the required code and data is available for the build scripts:

    $HOME/sabuildtools

  All can be copied (or symlinked) from ~jm on minotaur if required.

- ensure your PATH is correct, with the right perl FIRST in the path:

    PATH=$HOME/sabuildtools/perl584/bin:$HOME/sabuildtools/bin:$PATH

- run "./build/update_devel" to build the tar.gz files

- by default, they're written to ~/site/devel/ . 
  Copy them to wherever you want, yourself.


SPAMASSASSIN RELEASE PROCEDURE
==============================

- cd to the directory for the codebase you want the release to
  come from

    ssh minotaur.apache.org
    cd [checkedoutdir]

- ensure the required code and data is available for the build scripts:
  see above.

- ensure your PATH is correct, with the right perl FIRST in the path:

    PATH=$HOME/sabuildtools/perl584/bin:$HOME/sabuildtools/bin:$PATH

- edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm and comment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD
  line.   Ensure the correct version number is present in $VERSION
  and $EXTRA_VERSION.

  Prerelease versions are formatted like this -- "pre4" -- in
  $EXTRA_VERSION, and $IS_DEVEL_BUILD is left as 1 instead of commented.
  When referred to in full, it's "3.1.0-pre4".

  [NOTE: when editing files in these instructions, you may have to
  use another checkout somewhere else, check in the changes there,
  then 'svn update' in the release account -- since I think it
  builds from a read-only checkout.]

- Ensure the new version number takes hold:

    make clean ; perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null ; make
    ./spamassassin -L -t < sample-nonspam.txt | grep X-Spam-

  Verify that the X-Spam-* headers use the correct version string,
  without an SVN revision number (those are only for dev builds).

- create the Changes file.  Do this step on your own checkout, as
  the release checkout is read-only.   There are two options here:

  - For releases on a maintainance branch (e.g. 3.0.1, .2, etc.):

      TZ=UTC svn log --non-interactive --stop-on-copy > Changes

    This will output all of the changes since the .0 release in the
    current branch (the last copy -- note, if a copy was done
    afterwards (move between repositories, etc, you'll need to
    modify that command).

  - For releases on the trunk (e.g. a .0 release):

      TZ=UTC svn log -r HEAD:46030 --non-interactive > Changes

    r46030 was the start of the 3.1.0 work (created 3.0 branch); replace
    with the correct rev number for the point you want to start at
    if different.

- Check in the updated Changes file.

    svn commit -m "preparing to release X.Y.Z" Changes

- SVN tag the release files.  This is done using "svn copy".
  For a maintainance release (x.y.1, x.y.2):

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release 3.0.1" \
	$repo/branches/3.0 \
	$repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_0_1

  For a trunk release (x.y.0):

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release 3.0.0" \
	$repo/trunk \
	$repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_0_0

  For a trunk pre-release (x.y.0-preZ):

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn copy -m "creating tag for release 3.1.0-pre2" \
	$repo/branches/3.1 \
	$repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_1_0_pre_2

  This will do a completely server-side tagging (which is the same as
  a branch really) of whatever the latest branch revision to be the new
  base of the tag release.

- run "make distcheck" to ensure all files are included in the
  distribution that should be, and to ensure all files that are listed
  in the MANIFEST also exist in SVN.

    make distcheck

- run "make disttest" to ensure all tests pass once the distribution
  is fully packaged.  (this'll take a minute or two.)

    make disttest < /dev/null

- run "./build/update_stable" to build the tar.gz files.

    ./build/update_stable

- take a copy of the MD5sum line output.

- by default, they're written to ~/site/released/ .
  Copy them to wherever you want, yourself.

- test the tar.gz and zip files!  redo until they work!! ;)

- Propose a release, and post the URL and md5sums/sha1sums to the
  dev list.  Once you've got 2 committer +1's, in addition to your own,
  carry on:

- SVN commit the release files, including 'Changes':

	svn commit -m "X.Y.Z RELEASED"

- Now, start the new development codebase.  For minor updates of a 2.x
  tree (e.g. 2.x1, 2.x2), you don't need to branch; for major updates
  (2.x0) you should use a new development branch, off the trunk.

    repo=https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin
    svn copy $repo/tags/spamassassin_release_3_0_0 \
           $repo/branches/b3_0_0

  "trunk" is SVN's concept of head.  Typically, our branches are named
  for their minor version number.  In the example above, b3_0_0 is the
  branch for the stable 3.0.x releases.

- In the new development codeline, edit lib/Mail/SpamAssassin.pm, bump the
  $VERSION line to the correct version, and uncomment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD
  line.

- then, commit the new version number to the new branch:

        svn commit -m "X.Y.N devel cycle started"

	(where X.Y.N is the new version number)

- (for any rc, prerelease, or full release) Place the tarballs in a
  discreet location (discreet means not linked from downloads, but
  included in the vote mail) and request a vote on the development
  mailing list to make the release, three +1 votes are required to make
  the release official.  The release manager (that's you) may vote as
  well.  Once there are three or more +1 votes, you may proceed.

- !WARNING! After the next step, the version number will be considered
  "burned". The number is locked for this particular code.  The same
  number cannot be used for a future different release.  So make sure
  you're happy before you go on!

  If you need to redo something, re-comment the $IS_DEVEL_BUILD line,
  revert the $VERSION bump, and go back to 'Ensure the new version number
  takes hold'.  You can retag with the normal 'svn copy' command used in
  'SVN tag the release files', even if that tag already existed; but be
  sure to check in another commit message to note what happened, e.g.:

    svn commit -m "oops, had to redo: THIS IS THE REAL X.Y.Z RELEASE"

- publish the tarballs.

  (for rc and prerelease builds) copy the tarballs to the website.

        cp -p ~/site/released/Mail-SpamAssassin-$version.* \
            /www/spamassassin.apache.org/devel/

  BTW, note that http://spamassassin.apache.org/devel/ is served via a
  mirror which takes several hours to catch up.  However that directory is
  ALSO accessible directly, and immediately, as

        http://people.apache.org/~jm/devel/

  (for full release builds) copy the tarballs to www.apache.org/dist:

        version=X.Y.Z
        cp -p ~/site/released/Mail-SpamAssassin-$version.* \
            /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin/source

        cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin
        cp -p source/Mail-SpamAssassin-$version.* .

        chmod -R g+w /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin

  [note: the ASF archives documentation claims that symlinks are
  supported. This is not the case for some mirrors, so use "cp" instead.]

  (for full release builds) remove release tarballs from now-obsolete
  versions from dist:

        cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/spamassassin
        prev=X.Y.notZ
        rm -f source/Mail-SpamAssassin-$prev.*
        rm -f binaries/*/Mail-SpamAssassin-$prev.*

  (Archive copies are automatically kept on archive.apache.org/dist/ .)

- (for full release builds) update the main website "downloads" page:

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        vi main.wmk

  See the comment at the top of the file; you'll need to change at
  least one variable ("relversion") to the new version number, and
  possibly more, depending on if this is the first release of a new
  release line.

- rebuild the SpamAssassin website with webmake:

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        webmake -F

- update the 'dist' tree in the SpamAssassin website:

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        svn up
        svn delete --force full/3.1.x
        svn commit -m "removing old dist tree"

        cd [checkedoutdir]
        build/update_website_docs

        cd /www/spamassassin.apache.org
        svn add full/3.1.x
        svn commit -m "updating new dist tree" full

- and check the entire website into SVN (see bug 4998 for reasons why).
  Note that you may need to resolve conflicts and ensure the contents of
  'full/3.1.x' are all added successfully:

        svn up
        svn add full/3.1.x
        svn commit -m "added new release"

- upload to CPAN at http://pause.cpan.org/

  ( https://pause.perl.org/pause/authenquery?ACTION=add_uri )

- Before doing the next step, run through the Changes file, and write up a
  quick summary of the important changes in human-readable format.  This
  should be less than 600 chars to fit into Freshmeat's format, and
  to be easily understandable.

- announce to Freshmeat at http://freshmeat.net/

  ( http://freshmeat.net/add-release/14876/ may work )

- announce on SpamAssassin-Users, SpamAssassin-Dev, and
  SpamAssassin-Announce.  Be sure to include the MD5 checksums in this
  mail, so paranoid folks can check the tarball's integrity.

- Approve the posting to SpamAssassin-Announce (the list admins will get a
  mail indicating how to do this.)
