# Whitelist rules
#
# Note that most of these get 'noautolearn'.  They should not be
# considered when deciding whether to auto-learn a message, as a
# user slip-up could result in scribbling side-effects in the bayes
# db as a result -- which is hard to remedy.

# Default whitelists.  These should be addresses which send mail that is often
# tagged (incorrectly) as spam; it also helps that they be addresses of big
# companies with lots of lawyers, so if spammers impersonate them, they'll get
# into big trouble, so it doesn't provide a shortcut around SpamAssassin.
#
# Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so
# "friend@somewhere.com", "*@isp.com", or "*.domain.net" will all work.
#
# Please do not add unmoderated public mailing lists here.  They are
# too easily abused by spammers.

# Should really not be used these days, use def_whitelist_auth if possible.

# def_whitelist_from_rcvd  *@foo.com  foo.com
