=head1 NAME

spamassassin - mail filter to identify spam using text analysis

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item spamassassin [option ...] < mailmessage

=item spamassassin -P [option ...] < mailmessage > output

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-P>

Normally SpamAssassin will write the rewritten message to the mail spool by
default.  The B<-P> parameter will cause it to pipe the output to STDOUT
instead.

=item B<-e>

Exit with a non-zero error code, if the message is determined to be
spam.

=item B<-h>

Print help message and exit.

=item B<-t>

Test mode.  Pipe message through and add extra report.

=item B<-r>

Report this message as verified spam.  This will submit the mail message read
from STDIN to various spam-blocker databases, such as Vipul's Razor (
http://razor.sourceforge.net/ ).

If the message contains SpamAssassin markup, this will be stripped out
automatically before submission.

=item B<-W>

Add all email addresses, in the headers of the mail message read
from STDIN, to the automatic whitelist.

=item B<-w> I<fromaddr>

This flag is only useful in conjunction with B<-r>.  It will send a reply mail
to the sender of the tested mail, notifying them that their message has been
trapped as spam, from the address supplied in I<fromaddr>.  See L</SPAM TRAPPING>.

=item B<-l> I<filename>

Log all mail messages that pass through the filter, to an mbox-format file
named by I<filename>.  Handy for use with B<-r> and B<-w>.

=item B<-L>

Do only the ''local'' tests, ones that do not require an internet connection to
operate.  Normally, SpamAssassin will try to detect whether you are connected
to the net before doing these tests anyway, but for faster checks you may wish
to use this.

=item B<-d>

Remove SpamAssassin markup (the "SpamAssassin results" report, X-Spam-Status
headers, etc.) from the mail message.  The resulting message, which will be
more or less identical to the original, pre-SpamAssassin input, will be output
to stdout.

(Note: the message will not be exactly identical; some headers will be
reformatted due to some features of the Mail::Internet package, but the body
text will be.)

=item B<-c> I<config>

Read configuration from I<config>.

=item B<-p> I<prefs>

Read user score preferences from I<prefs>.

=item B<-D>

Produce diagnostic output.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam using text analysis and several
internet-based realtime blacklists.

Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers
and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited commercial email.

Once identified, the mail is then tagged as spam for later filtering using the
user's own mail user-agent application.

SpamAssassin also includes support for reporting spam messages to collaborative
filtering databases, such as Vipul's Razor ( http://razor.sourceforge.net/ ).

The default tagging operations that take place are detailed in L</TAGGING>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILES

The rule base, text templates, and rule description text are loaded from the
configuration files.

The default configuration file is F<$Config{installsitelib}/spamassassin.cf>.
This file will always be read first.

F</etc/spamassassin.cf> (or the file specified with C<-c>)  will be read next,
if it exists.  This is a good place to add your own site-wide preferences.

The user preferences (such as scores to attach to each rule), are loaded from
the file specified in the B<-p> argument.  If this is not specified,
F<~/.spamassassin.cf> is used if it exists.  C<spamassassin> will create this
file if it does not exist, using F<$Config{installsitelib}/spamassassin.prefs>
as a template.

=head1 TAGGING

The following two sections detail the tagging that takes place for
spam messages, first of all, and for non-spam messages.

Note that if you use the B<-t> argument, all mails will be tagged
as if they are spam messages.

=head2 TAGGING FOR SPAM MAILS

The modifications made are as follows:

=over 4

=item Subject: header

The string C<*****SPAM*****> is prepended to the subject,
unless the C<rewrite_subject 0> configuration option is given.

=item X-Spam-Status: header

A string, C<Yes, hits=nn required=nn> is set in this header to reflect
the filter status.

=item X-Spam-Flag: header

Set to C<YES>.

=item X-Spam-Report: header for spam mails

The SpamAssassin report is added to the mail header if
the C<report_header = 1> configuration option is given.

=item Content-Type: header

Set to C<text/plain>, in order to defang HTML mail or other active
content that could "call back" to the spammer.

=item spam mail body text

The SpamAssassin report is added to top of the mail message body,
unless the C<report_header 1> configuration option is given.


=back

=head2 TAGGING FOR NON-SPAM MAILS

=over 4

=item X-Spam-Status: header

A string, C<No, hits=nn required=nn> is set in this header to reflect
the filter status.

=back

=head1 SPAM TRAPPING

Quite often, if you've been on the internet for a while, you'll have
accumulated a few old email accounts that nowadays get nothing but
spam.

SpamAssassin lets you set them up as aliases, as follows:

=over 4

=item spamtrap1: "| /path/to/spamassassin -r -w spamtrap1"

=back

This will add any incoming mail messages straight into spam-tracking databases,
such as Vipul's Razor; send an explanatory reply message to the sender, from
the I<spamtrap1> address; then drop the mail into the bit-bucket.

The explanatory reply text is taken from the SpamAssassin configuration file,
where it is stored in the C<spamtrap> lines.

If you want to keep a copy of the mails, use something like this:

=over 4

=item spamtrap1: "| /path/to/spamassassin -r -w spamtrap1 -l /var/spam/caught"

=back

It is suggested you familiarise yourself with how MTAs run programs specified
in aliases, if you plan to do this; for one thing, B<spamassassin> will not run
under your user id in this case.  If you are nervous about this, create a user
for spamtrapping, and set up spamassassin in its F<.forward> file.

=head1 INSTALLATION

The B<spamassassin> command is part of the B<Mail::SpamAssassin> Perl module.
Install this as a normal Perl module, using C<perl -MCPAN -e shell>, or by
hand.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

No environment variables, aside from those used by perl, are required to
be set.
