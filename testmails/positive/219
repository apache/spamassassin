Our research has found that many people have tried one or more of
the following...
 
    Free Classifieds? (Don't work anymore)
    Web Site? (Takes thousands of visitors)
    Banners? (Expensive and losing their punch)
    E-Zine? (Hope they have a *huge* subscriber list)
    Search Engines? (Forget it, unless you're in the top 20)
    
         S O   W H A T   W I L L   W O R K ? 

Although often misunderstood, there is one method that has proven
to succeed time-after-time.

         E - M A I L   M A R K E T I N G ! !

IT'S A FACT... It if you're not using your computer to generate
income,  GOOD income,  you're leaving money on the table.  

Here's what the experts have to say about E-Mail Marketing:

"E-mail is an incredible lead generation tool"
-Crains Magazine

"A gold mine for those who can take advantage of
bulk e-mail programs" - The New York Times

"Blows away traditional Mailing" - Advertising Age

Here's an example of your potential earnings if you have a
product or service that brings you a profit of around $30.
Remember, on the Internet, you can make money 7 days a week, 24
hours a day... even while you sleep, orders come from all over
the world!

***New Just Released - and now, 19 Million addresses***

We have just increased our list size from 15-million to
19-million without a corresponding increase in price! 

          M I L L I O N S   V O L U M E   14
 
Over the past 6 years, we have gained a reputation for having the
cleanest, most responsive e-mail address lists in the industry.
No one has gone to the work it takes to produce an e-mail address
list of this quality.

Here's how we prepare our e-mail lists:

1. We clean and eliminate all duplicates. 

2. Next, we use a filter list of 400+ words/phrases to clean even
more. No address with inappropriate or profane wording survives!

3. Then we use our private database of thousands of known
Internet "extremists", those opposed to any kind of commercial
e-mail, and kicked off every one we could find.

4. All domains were verified to insure they're valid.

5. And finally, we sorted the list into easy-to-manage packets of
20,000 addresses in simple text (.txt) format that will work with
any computer operating system. 

WHAT DID WE END UP WITH?


     M I L L I O N S   V O L U M E   14
     
                   19 Million Addresses Strong!
 
With this super clean e-mail address lists you'll send less...and
get better results... 
 
    * Y O U   G E T   W H A T   Y O U   P A Y   F O R *

* Higher Response Rates
* Higher Sales Conversion Ratios
* More Receptive prospects; Less Flames & Non-Buyers.
* Less Contact With Anti-Commerce Radicals & Extremists.
 
Remember that potential income chart at the beginning of
this message? Can you imagine the kind of money you could
make if you mailed one million pieces and sold only one
tenth (.01%) of one percent?  You do the math, you'll be
amazed!
                    
This is not a rental list that is restricted to a one-time
mailing.  You are purchasing an e-mail address list for your 
personal mailings and may use it over-and-over.

DON'T HESITATE on this offer or you will miss out on the least
expensive, most effective way to market... PERIOD!
