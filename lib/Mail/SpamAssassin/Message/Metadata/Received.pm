# So, what's the difference between a trusted and untrusted Received header?
# Basically, relays we *know* are trustworthy are 'trusted', all others after
# the last one of those are 'untrusted'.
#
# We determine trust by detecting if they are inside the network ranges
# specified in 'trusted_networks'.  There is also an inference algorithm
# which determines other trusted relays without user configuration.
#
# There's another type of Received header: the semi-trusted one.  This is the
# header added by *our* MX, at the boundary of trust; we can trust the IP
# address (and possibly rDNS) in this header, but that's about it; HELO name is
# untrustworthy.  We just use this internally for now.
#
# Finally, there's also 'internal_networks'.  These are the networks that you
# control; your MXes should be included.  This way, if you specify a wide range
# of trusted hosts, a mail that is relayed from a dynamic IP address via a
# 'trusted' host will not hit RCVD_IN_DYNABLOCK.

    # "from (remote.rDNS|unknown)" is always there
    # "(HELO machine.domain.com)" is there only if HELO differs from remote rDNS.
    # HELO may be "" -- ie no string. "HELO" may also be "EHLO".  HELO string
    # may be an IP in fmt [1.2.3.4] -- do not strip [ and ], they are important.
    # "foobar@" is remote IDENT info, specified only if ident given by remote
    # Remote IP always appears between (parentheses), with or without IDENT@
    # "by local.system.domain.com" always appears
    #
    # Protocol can be different from "SMTP", i.e. "RC4-SHA encrypted SMTP" or "QMQP"
    # qmail's reported protocol shouldn't be "ESMTP", so by allowing only "with (.* )(SMTP|QMQP)"
    # we should avoid matching on some sendmailish Received: lines that reports remote IP
    # between ([218.0.185.24]) like qmail-ldap does, but use "with ESMTP".
    #
    # Normally, qmail-smtpd remote IP isn't between square brackets [], but some versions of
    # qmail-ldap seem to add square brackets around remote IP. These versions of qmail-ldap
    # use a longer format that also states the (envelope-sender <sender@domain>) and the
    # qmail-ldap version. Example:
    # Received: from unknown (HELO terpsichore.farfalle.com) (jdavid@[216.254.40.70]) (envelope-sender <jdavid@farfalle.com>) by mail13.speakeasy.net (qmail-ldap-1.03) with SMTP for <jm@jmason.org>; 12 Feb 2003 18:23:19 -0000

    # Some others of the numerous qmail patches out there can also add variants of their own
