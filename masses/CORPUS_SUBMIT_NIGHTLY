How To Submit Nightly Mass-check Results
========================================


The first time you do this: check out the CVS version of SpamAssassin, using
"CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION" as a tag:

  cd /home/you/directory
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.spamassassin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/spamassassin \
                login
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.spamassassin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/spamassassin \
                co -r CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION spamassassin


Every night from then on, check out the correct version of SpamAssassin.  This
is tagged nightly using "CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION":

  cd /home/you/directory/spamassassin
  cvs -z3 update -dP -r CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION


Next, cd to the "masses" subdir and create a new pair of mass-check logfiles
using that tag.

  cd /home/you/directory/spamassassin/masses
  rm nonspam.log spam.log
  touch nonspam.log spam.log


Run all your mass-check scripts into those logfiles.  This is up to you!


Finally submit them to belphegore.  Replace "you" with the username
Craig gave you (ask him for one!), ditto for the password.

  RSYNC_PASSWORD="[whatever_craig_told_you_it_was]"
  export RSYNC_PASSWORD
  rsync -CPcvuzb nonspam.log \
        you@belphegore.hughes-family.org::corpus/nonspam-you.log
  rsync -CPcvuzb spam.log \
        you@belphegore.hughes-family.org::corpus/spam-you.log


That's it.
