RESCORING SURVEY: HOW TO TAKE PART
----------------------------------

The tools in this directory are used to optimise the scoring system used for
incoming mails, using a genetic algorithm to search for optimal values.

Since this works best with a very large dataset, it would be *great* if you
(as a user) could run this and mail the results back to me.

The analysis script will not include text from the mails themselves, so
it will not give away private details from your mail spool.  The only
details you'll give away will be your email address (and I promise *NEVER*
to give that out or use it for spammy stuff) -- and how many mails you
have sitting around in folders!


CONDITIONS
----------

1. First of all, you must be running it on a UNIX system; it's not portable to
other OSes yet.  Also currently it only reads UNIX mailbox format files, or MH
spool directories.

2. This will not work unless you have separated the mail messages you'll be
analysing into separate "spam" and "non-spam" piles.  It doesn't matter how
many mailboxes contain spam, or how many mailboxes contain non-spam; you just
need to be sure you know which set is which!

The latter is most important.  If you have occasional spams scattered through
your mailboxes, or occasional non-spam messages in your trapped spam folder,
the analysis will be useless.


HOW TO PARTICIPATE
------------------

Here's what to do:

  - let's say you have 4 mailboxes, "incoming", "work", "foo" and "spam",
    all in the ~/Mail directory.  "spam" is (obviously) the one where you
    keep all the spam!

  - run the mass-check script for the non-spam folders:

	: > nonspam.log
	./mass-check ~/Mail/incoming >> nonspam.log
	./mass-check ~/Mail/work >> nonspam.log
	./mass-check ~/Mail/foo >> nonspam.log

    This is a *lot* faster than the standard, more paranoid incoming-mail
    checks, since it runs without doing DNS or Razor lookups and without
    forking subprocesses.  However it can still take a while for large numbers
    of messages.

  - next, run it for the spam folder(s), if you have any:

	: > spam.log
	./mass-check ~/Mail/spam >> spam.log

  - Take a quick look.  You should see lines like this:

.  3 /home/jm/Mail/MissedSpam/36 SUBJ_HAS_Q_MARK,WANTS_CREDIT_CARD,SUPERLONG_LINE

    Each line basically lists the path to the message (or its message ID),
    the number of hits it got, and the tests it triggered. The latter
    is the most important info, because the GA can then tweak those tests,
    optimising the test scores until the maximum correct diagnoses
    are made.

    As you can see, there's no indication what the mail is about -- so your
    privacy is protected.

  - gzip them:
  
  	gzip spam.log nonspam.log

  - and mail them to me. These commands will mail them as attachments in two
    mail messages:

        metasend -b -s "RESCORE: spam" -t rescore@jmason.org -c '' \
		-m application/octet-stream -f spam.log.gz
        metasend -b -s "RESCORE: nonspam" -t rescore@jmason.org -c '' \
		-m application/octet-stream -f nonspam.log.gz


That's it.  I can then take that data and run it through the evolver.
Thanks for contributing!!


HOW IT WORKS
------------

If you're interested, here's a quick description of the rest of the stuff
in this directory and what they do:

mass-check :

  This script is used to perform "mass checks" of a set of mailboxes, Cyrus
  folders, and/or MH mail spools.  It generates summary lines like this:

  Y  7 /home/jm/Mail/Sapm/1382 SUBJ_ALL_CAPS,SUPERLONG_LINE,SUBJ_FULL_OF_8BITS

  or for mailboxes,

  .  1 /path/to/mbox:<5.1.0.14.2.20011004073932.05f4fd28@localhost> TRACKER_ID,BALANCE_FOR_LONG

  listing the path to the message or its message ID, its score, and the tests
  that triggered on that mail.

  Using this info, and the genetic algorithm in evolve.cxx, I can figure out
  which tests get good hits with few false positives, etc., and re-score the
  tests to optimise the ratio.

  This script relies on the spamassassin distribution directory living in "..".


logs-to-c :

  Takes the "spam.log" and "nonspam.log" files and converts them into C
  source files and simplified data files for use by the "evolve" genetic
  algorithm.  (Called by "make" when you build the evolver, so generally
  you won't need to run it yourself.)


evolve.cxx :

  Source for "evolve".  To build this, use "make".  Note that it requires
  GAlib ( ftp://lancet.mit.edu/pub/ga/ ) unpacked in a dir called "galib245"
  to build.  Alternatively just mail the data files to me and I'll run
  evolve for all of us ;)


hit-frequencies :

  Analyses the log files and computes how often each test hits, overall,
  for spam mails and for non-spam.


mk-baseline-results :

  Compute results for the baseline scores (read from ../rules/*).  If you
  provide the name of a config directory as the first argument, it'll use that
  instead.


continual_evolve.sh :

  Continually runs the evolver, saving each run's best genome (and its results)
  into separate files named "result.n" where n starts at 1 and counts up.
  Handy for running overnight.
