# SVN version; minor tweaks, removed scores and published/redundant rules.

# FCrDNS possibilities (4 and 5 aren't technically FCrDNS failures):
# 1:  IP -> rDNS: Domain -> DNS: IP2 -> FAIL (mismatch) -> KHOP_MAYBE_FORGED
# 2:  IP -> rDNS: [none] ->-> FAIL (no rDNS) -> RDNS_NONE
# 3:  IP -> rDNS: Domain -> DNS: [none] -> FAIL (no DNS) -> uncaught
# 4:  IP -> rDNS: Domain != HELO -> ~FAIL -> KHOP_HELO_FCRDNS
# 5:  HELO -> DNS: IP2 != IP -> ~FAIL -> uncaught

# Sendmail's FCrDNS, see http://www.sendmail.org/faq/section3#3.38
