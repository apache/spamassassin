# Pretty decent Outlook forgery.  At the very least, they finally start to get
# the Message-Id correct.  And indeed, the MIME multipart boundary and the
# Message-Id do share the same format.  However, the timestamps are created
# *individually*, and there pretty much is no way for a human that these could
# be identical.  Only a bot can do that.

# A bunch of spam, in particular a couple variants of some rather static
# German spam recently started avoiding the gross forgery KB_RATWARE_MSGID and
# FORGED_RELAY_MUA_TO_MX, as well as some blacklists.  An opportunity to look
# for more forgery.  I don't need your bloody payload, the headers are
# sufficient to block you.
