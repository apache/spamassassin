Welcome to SpamAssassin!
------------------------

SpamAssassin is a mail filter which attempts to identify spam using text
analysis and several internet-based realtime blacklists.

Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers
and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited commercial email.

Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for later
filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.

In its most recent test, SpamAssassin differentiated between spam and non-spam
mail correctly in 99.94% of cases.

SpamAssassin also includes support for reporting spam messages automatically,
and/or manually, to collaborative filtering databases such as Vipul's Razor
[1].

The distribution provides "spamassassin", a command line tool to perform
filtering, along with "Mail::SpamAssassin", a set of perl modules which
implement a Mail::Audit plugin, allowing SpamAssassin to be used in a
Mail::Audit filter or (possibly at some point) in a spam-protection proxy
POP/IMAP server.

SpamAssassin lives at http://spamassassin.taint.org/ or in CPAN, and is
distributed under Perl's Artistic license.

This module owes a lot of inspiration to Mark Jeftovic's filter.plx, which I
contributed some code to (and used, of course).  However, SpamAssassin is a
ground-up rewrite with a new, improved ruleset, and a different code model and
installation system, and hopefully will be easy to adapt for a multitude of
applications.

Installing SpamAssassin
-----------------------

The easiest way to do this is using CPAN.pm, like so:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install Mail::SpamAssassin
	quit

Alternatively download the tarfile or zipfile from
http://spamassassin.taint.org/ and install that like so:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd spamassassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install		[as root]

You will require the Mail::Audit module, and any modules it requires.  Here's
how to install this using CPAN.pm:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install Mail::Audit
	quit

There is a problem with Mail::Audit versions up to and including 1.9, which
will cause mail to be rewritten as it passes through Mail::Audit.  SpamAssassin
will still work OK, although some aspects (Razor matching in particular) may
not provide any hits as a result, and the "strip2" test in the SpamAssassin
test suite will fail.

A patch has been submitted to the author of Mail::Audit, so hopefully the
next version will work OK.  In the meantime, you may wish to apply the
patch yourself; see the file "MailAudit.patch" in this directory in that
case.

In addition, the following modules will be used for some checks, if available.
If they are not available, SpamAssassin will still work, just not as
effectively -- some of the spam-detection tests will have to be skipped.

  - Net::DNS	(from CPAN)

    Used to check the RBL, RSS, DUL etc. and perform MX checks.

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install Net::DNS
	quit

  - Razor	http://razor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against Vipul's Razor collaborative
    filtering network.  (Note that Razor itself requires several perl modules;
    at the time of writing, these are Persistence::Object::Simple, Net::Daemon,
    Digest::SHA1, and Mail::Internet).

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install Persistence::Object::Simple
	install Net::Daemon
	install Digest::SHA1
	install Mail::Internet			[this may already be installed]
	quit



Using SpamAssassin
------------------


Steps to take for every installation:

    - Install Mail::Audit and Mail::SpamAssassin on your mail server, as above.

    - Test it:

    	spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out
    	spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > spam.out

      Verify (using a text viewer, ie. "less" or "notepad") that nonspam.out
      has not been tagged as spam, and that spam.out has.  The files should
      contain the full text and headers of the messages, the "spam.out" message
      should be annotated with a report from SpamAssassin, and there should be
      no errors when you run the commands.

      (Note that there may be a warning from -w about a deprecated usage
      in Net::DNS; this is totally harmless, but ugly. Until Net::DNS is
      fixed this is unavoidable) :(

      If the commands do not work, DO NOT PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP, as you
      will lose mail!



If you want to use Mail::Audit:

    - run "perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin" and take a look at the synopsis, it
      outlines what you need to add to your audit script.

    - Copy the configuration files (see CUSTOMISING, below) to a known
      location, so your script can set the appropriate options for
      Mail::SpamAssassin to load them.



If you're using procmail:

    - Make a backup of your .procmailrc (if it exists).

    	cp ~/.procmailrc ~/.procmailrc.bak

    - add the following lines to ~/.procmailrc, at the top of the file
      before any existing recipes:

        :0fhw
        | spamassassin -P

        :0:  
        * ^Subject:.*\*\*\*\*SPAM\*\*\*\*
        caughtspam

      That'll process all mail through SA, and refile spam messages to
      a folder called "caughtspam" in your home directory.

    - Send yourself a mail message, and ensure it gets to you.  If it does not,
      copy your old backed-up .procmailrc file back into place and ask your
      sysadmin for help!  Here's commands to do that:

      	cp ~/.procmailrc.bak ~/.procmailrc
	echo "Help!" | mail root



If you don't use any mail filter just yet:

    - Make a backup of your .forward (if it exists).

    	cp ~/.forward ~/.forward.bak

    - Change your ~/.forward file so it reads like this:

    	"| spamassassin || exit 75"

    - Send yourself a mail message, and ensure it gets to you.  If it does not,
      copy your old backed-up .forward file back into place and ask your
      sysadmin for help!  Here's commands to do that:

      	cp ~/.forward.bak ~/.forward
	echo "Help!" | mail root



Other installation notes:

    - If you get spammed, it is helpful to everyone else if you re-run
      spamassassin with the "-r" option to report the message in question as
      "verified spam".  This will add it to Vipul's Razor
      (http://razor.sourceforge.net/), a collaborative spam filtering network.

	spamassassin -r < spam-message

      If you use mutt as your mail reader, this macro will bind the X key
      to report a spam message.

	macro index X "| spamassassin -r"

      This is, of course, optional -- but you'll get lots of good-netizen
      karma. ;)

    - Quite often, if you've been on the internet for a while, you'll have
      accumulated a few old email accounts that nowadays get nothing but spam.
      You can set these up as spam traps using SpamAssassin; see the ''SPAM
      TRAPPING'' section of the spamassassin manual page for details.


Customising
-----------

When installing SpamAssassin, the configuration files defining the list of
rules and the default user preferences are written to INSTALLSITELIB, or
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005 (or similar) on a typical UNIX system.

Users who run "spamassassin" will receive a copy of the user preferences in
their home directories as the file "~/.spamassassin.cf".  This allows them to
edit their preferences and reweight the rules, or to increase or decrease the
"line in the sand" at which point a mail is judged spam (or not).

Systems administrators can edit the
"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/spamfilter.cf" file to add new rules for all
users on the system, or they can edit
"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/spamfilter.prefs" to set default preferences
for the users.  Note that the "/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005" path changes,
depending on your OS and the version of perl you have installed
(unfortunately).

There is no difference in interpretation between the rules file and the
preferences file, so users can add new rules for their own use in the
"~/.spamfilter.cf" file, if they like.
