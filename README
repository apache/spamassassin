Welcome to SpamAssassin!
------------------------

SpamAssassin is a mail filter which attempts to identify spam using text
analysis and several internet-based realtime blacklists.

Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail
headers and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited
commercial email.

Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for later
filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.

In its most recent test, SpamAssassin differentiated between spam and
non-spam mail correctly in 99.94% of cases.

SpamAssassin also includes support for reporting spam messages
automatically, and/or manually, to collaborative filtering databases such
as Vipul's Razor [1].

The distribution provides "spamassassin", a command line tool to perform
filtering, along with "Mail::SpamAssassin", a set of perl modules which
implement a Mail::Audit plugin, allowing SpamAssassin to be used in a
Mail::Audit filter or (possibly at some point) in a spam-protection proxy
POP/IMAP server.

SpamAssassin lives at http://spamassassin.taint.org/ or in CPAN, and is
distributed under Perl's Artistic license.

This module owes a lot of inspiration to Mark Jeftovic's filter.plx, which
I contributed some code to (and used, of course).  However, SpamAssassin
is a ground-up rewrite with a new, improved ruleset, and a different code
model and installation system, and hopefully will be easy to adapt for a
multitude of applications.

Installing SpamAssassin
-----------------------

The easiest way to do this is using CPAN.pm, like so:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Mail::SpamAssassin
	quit

Alternatively download the tarfile or zipfile from
http://spamassassin.taint.org/ and install that like so:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd spamassassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install				[as root]

You will require the Mail::Audit module, and any modules it requires.
Here's how to install this using CPAN.pm:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Mail::Audit
	quit

There is a problem with Mail::Audit versions up to and including 1.9,
which will cause mail to be rewritten as it passes through Mail::Audit.
SpamAssassin will still work OK, although some aspects (Razor matching in
particular) may not provide any hits as a result, and the "strip2" test in
the SpamAssassin test suite will fail.

A patch has been submitted to the author of Mail::Audit, so hopefully the
next version will work OK.  In the meantime, you may wish to apply the
patch yourself; see the file "MailAudit.patch" in this directory in that
case.



Optional Additional Modules
---------------------------

In addition, the following modules will be used for some checks, if
available.  If they are not available, SpamAssassin will still work, just
not as effectively -- some of the spam-detection tests will have to be
skipped.


  - Net::DNS	(from CPAN)

    Used to check the RBL, RSS, DUL etc. and perform MX checks.
    Recommended.

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Net::DNS
	quit

  - Razor	http://razor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against Vipul's Razor collaborative
    filtering network.  Razor is currently in prototype, so it's not yet
    available from CPAN -- you have to download it from the URL above.

    Note that Razor itself requires several perl modules; at the time of
    writing, these are Persistence::Object::Simple, Digest::SHA1,
    Time::HiRes, Net::Ping, and Mail::Internet:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Persistence::Object::Simple
	install Net::Ping
	install Time::HiRes
	install Digest::SHA1
	install Mail::Internet			[this may already be installed]
	quit



Using SpamAssassin
------------------


Steps to take for every installation:

  - Install Mail::Audit and Mail::SpamAssassin on your mail server, as
    above.

  - Test it:

      spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out
      spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > spam.out

    Verify (using a text viewer, ie. "less" or "notepad") that nonspam.out
    has not been tagged as spam, and that spam.out has.  The files should
    contain the full text and headers of the messages, the "spam.out"
    message should be annotated with "****SPAM****" in the subject line
    and a report from SpamAssassin, and there should be no errors when you
    run the commands.

    Even though sample-nonspam.txt is not spam, nonspam.out will contain a
    SpamAssassin report anyway.  This is a side-effect of the "-t" (test)
    switch.  However, there should be less than 5 hits accumulated; when
    the "-t" switch is not in use, the report text would not be added.

    (Also, if you use Perl 5.6, there may be a warning from Perl's -w
    switch about a deprecated usage in Net::DNS; this is totally harmless,
    but ugly.  Until Net::DNS is fixed this is unavoidable. :( )

    If the commands do not work, DO NOT PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP, as you
    will lose mail!



If you want to use Mail::Audit:

  - run "perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin" and take a look at the synopsis, it
    outlines what you need to add to your audit script.

  - Copy the configuration files (see CUSTOMISING, below) to a known
    location, so your script can set the appropriate options for
    Mail::SpamAssassin to load them.



If you're using procmail:

  - Make a backup of your .procmailrc (if it exists).

      cp ~/.procmailrc ~/.procmailrc.bak

  - add the following lines to ~/.procmailrc, at the top of the file
    before any existing recipes:

      :0f
      | spamassassin -P

      :0:  
      * ^Subject:.*\*\*\*\*SPAM\*\*\*\*
      caughtspam

    That'll process all mail through SA, and refile spam messages to
    a folder called "caughtspam" in your home directory.

  - Send yourself a mail message, and ensure it gets to you.  If it does
    not, copy your old backed-up .procmailrc file back into place and ask
    your sysadmin for help!  Here's commands to do that:

      cp ~/.procmailrc.bak ~/.procmailrc
      echo "Help!" | mail root



If you don't use any mail filter just yet:

  - Make a backup of your .forward (if it exists).

      cp ~/.forward ~/.forward.bak

  - Change your ~/.forward file so it reads like this:

      "| spamassassin || exit 75"

  - Send yourself a mail message, and ensure it gets to you.  If it does
    not, copy your old backed-up .forward file back into place and ask
    your sysadmin for help!  Here's commands to do that:

      cp ~/.forward.bak ~/.forward
      echo "Help!" | mail root



Other installation notes:

  - If you get spammed, it is helpful to everyone else if you re-run
    spamassassin with the "-r" option to report the message in question as
    "verified spam".  This will add it to Vipul's Razor
    (http://razor.sourceforge.net/), a collaborative spam filtering
    network.

      spamassassin -r < spam-message

    If you use mutt as your mail reader, this macro will bind the X key to
    report a spam message.

      macro index X "| spamassassin -r"

    This is, of course, optional -- but you'll get lots of good-netizen
    karma. ;)


  - Quite often, if you've been on the internet for a while, you'll have
    accumulated a few old email accounts that nowadays get nothing but
    spam.  You can set these up as spam traps using SpamAssassin; see the
    ''SPAM TRAPPING'' section of the spamassassin manual page for details.

    If you don't want to go to the bother of setting up a system yourself
    to do this, feel free to set up a simple alias to forward any mails to
    <someaddress@spamtraps.taint.org> -- replace "someaddress" with
    something to identify you, such as your email addr or website with
    non-alphanumeric chars replaced by underscores, or similar.   This
    will feed it into my spam-trapping system running on taint.org, where
    it will be fed into Razor.


Customising
-----------

When installing SpamAssassin, the configuration files defining the list of
rules and the default user preferences are written to INSTALLSITELIB, or
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005 (or similar) on a typical UNIX system.

Users who run "spamassassin" will receive a copy of the user preferences
in their home directories as the file "~/.spamassassin.cf".  This allows
them to edit their preferences and reweight the rules, or to increase or
decrease the "line in the sand" at which point a mail is judged spam (or
not).

Systems administrators can edit the
"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/spamfilter.cf" file to add new rules for
all users on the system, or they can edit
"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/spamfilter.prefs" to set default
preferences for the users.  Note that the "/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005"
path changes, depending on your OS and the version of perl you have
installed (unfortunately).

These paths are pretty ugly, but since SpamAssassin uses Perl's
Makefile-building system for portability and compatibility with CPAN,
they're currently unavoidable.  However, if you prefer, you can move these
files into /etc after installation, and SpamAssassin will pick them up
from there instead.

There is no difference in interpretation between the rules file and the
preferences file, so users can add new rules for their own use in the
"~/.spamfilter.cf" file, if they like.


Locali[sz]ation
---------------

All text displayed to users is taken from the configuration files.  This
means that you can translate messages, test descriptions, and templates
into other languages.

If you do so, I would *really* appreciate if you could send a copy back of
the updated messages; mail them to
<spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net> .  Hopefully if it takes off, I
can add them to the distribution as "official" translations and build in
support for this.  You will, of course, get credited for this work ;)


Help With SpamAssassin
----------------------

There's a mailing list for support or discussion of SpamAssassin.  It
lives at <spamassassin-talk@lists.sourceforge.net>.  See
http://spamassassin.taint.org/lists.html for the sign-up address and a
link to the archive of past messages.


Commercial Tests
----------------

There are several tests in the spamassassin configuration file which are
turned off by default, namely the mail-abuse.org and bl.spamcop.net tests.
The mail-abuse.org tests are RCVD_IN_RBL, RCVD_IN_RSS, and RCVD_IN_DUL;
the bl.spamcop.net test is called RCVD_IN_BL_SPAMCOP_NET.

These are both commercial services, so you need to pay money to use them.
Having said that, the bl.spamcop.net service gets my recommendation as the
most useful blacklisting DNS service I've found.  More information on it
can be found at http://spamcop.net/bl.shtml .

The mail-abuse.org tests are free for personal use, for now -- so if
you're using SpamAssassin as a personal mail filter you may turn them on.
More information on the mail-abuse.org services can be found here:
http://mail-abuse.org/rbl+/ and
http://www.mail-abuse.org/feestructure.html .

To turn on the tests, simply assign them a non-zero score, e.g. by adding
these lines to your ~/.spamassassin.cf file:

    score RCVD_IN_RBL               10
    score RCVD_IN_RSS               1
    score RCVD_IN_DUL               1
    score RCVD_IN_BL_SPAMCOP_NET    4
