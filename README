Welcome to SpamAssassin!
------------------------

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam using text analysis.

Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on mail headers
and body text to identify "spam", also known as unsolicited commercial email.

Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for later
filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.

The distribution provides a command line tool to perform filtering, along with
Mail::SpamAssassin, a set of perl modules which implement a Mail::Audit plugin,
allowing SpamAssassin to be used in a Mail::Audit filter, or (possibly at some
point) in a spam-protection proxy POP/IMAP server.

SpamAssassin lives at http://spamassassin.taint.org/ or in CPAN, and is
distributed under Perl's Artistic license.

SpamAssassin owes a lot of inspiration to Mark Jeftovic's filter.plx,
http://AntiSpam.shmOOze.net/filter/ , which I contributed some code to.
However, SpamAssassin is a ground-up rewrite with an entirely different
ruleset, and a different code model and installation system.



Installing SpamAssassin
-----------------------

The easiest way to do this is using CPAN.pm, like so:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install Mail::SpamAssassin
	quit

Alternatively download the tarfile or zipfile from
http://spamassassin.taint.org/ and install that like so:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd spamassassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install		[as root]

You will require the Mail::Audit module, and any modules it requires.   In
addition, these modules will be used for some checks, if available.  If they
are not available, SpamAssassin will still work, just not as effectively.

  - Net::DNS	(from CPAN)

    Used to check the RBL, RSS, DUL etc. and perform MX checks.

  - Razor	http://razor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against Vipul's Razor collaborative
    filtering network.



Using SpamAssassin
------------------


If you want to use Mail::Audit:

    - Install it on your mail server, as above.

    - run "perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin" and take a look at the synopsis, it
      outlines what you need to add to your audit script.



If you don't:

    - Install it on your mail server, as above.

    - Test it:

    	./spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out
    	./spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt > spam.out

      Verify (using a text viewer, ie. "less" or "notepad") that nonspam.out
      has not been tagged as spam, and that spam.out has.  The files should
      contain the full text and headers of the messages, and there should be no
      errors when you run the commands.

      If the commands do not work, DO NOT PROCEED TO THE NEXT STEP, as you
      will lose mail!

    - Make a backup of your .forward (if it exists).

    	cp ~/.forward ~/.forward.bak

    - Change your ~/.forward file so it reads like this:

    	"| /path/to/spamassassin > /var/spool/mail/username"

      Where "/path/to/spamassassin" is the path to where the "spamassassin"
      script is installed, and "/var/spool/mail/username" is the path to your
      mail spool.

    - Send yourself a mail message, and ensure it gets to you.  If it does not,
      copy your old backed-up .forward file back into place and ask your
      sysadmin for help!

      	cp ~/.forward.bak ~/.forward
	echo "Help!" | mail root



Customising
-----------

When installing SpamAssassin, the configuration files defining the list of
rules and the default user preferences are written to INSTALLSITELIB, or
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005 (or similar) on a typical UNIX system.

Users who run "spamassassin" will receive a copy of the user preferences in
their home directories as the file "~/.spamassassin.cf".  This allows them to
edit their preferences and reweight the rules, or to increase or decrease the
"line in the sand" at which point a mail is judged spam (or not).

Systems administrators can edit the
"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/spamfilter.cf" file to add new rules for all
users on the system, or they can edit
"/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.005/spamfilter.prefs" to set default preferences
for the users.

There is no difference in interpretation between the rules file and the
preferences file, so users can add new rules for their own use in the
~/.spamfilter.cf file, if they like.
