Using SpamAssassin With An SQL Database
---------------------------------------

SpamAssassin can now load users' score files from an SQL database.  The concept
here is to have a web application (PHP/perl/ASP/etc.) that will allow users to
be able to update their local preferences on how SpamAssassin will filter their
e-mail.  The most common use for a system like this would be for users to be
able to update the white list of addresses (whitelist_from) without the need
for them to update their $HOME/.spamassasin.cf file.  It is also quite common
for users listed in /etc/passwd to not have a home directory, therefore, the
only way to have their own local settings would be through an RDMS system.

SpamAssassin will check the global configuration file (normally
/etc/spamassassin.cf or /usr/local/lib/perl5/site-perl/<VER>/spamassassin.cf)
for the following settings:

user_scores_dsn			DBI:driver:database:hostname[:port]
user_scores_sql_username	dbusername
user_scores_sql_password	dbpassword

The first option, user_scores_dsn, describes the data source name that will be
used to create the connection to your SQL server.  It MUST be in the format
as listed above.  <driver> should be the DBD driver that you have installed
to access your database. <database> must be the name of the database that you
created to store the user preference table. <hostname> is the name of the host
that contains the SQL database server. <port> is the optional port number where
your database server is listening.

user_scores_dsn			DBI:mysql:spamassassin:localhost

Would tell SpamAssassin to connect to the database named spamassassin using
MySQL on the local server, and since <port> is omitted, the driver will use the
default port number.  The other two required options tells SpamAssassin to use 
the defined username and password to establish the connection.

If the user_scores_dsn option does not exist, SpamAssassin will not attempt
to use an SQL for retrieving users' preferences. Note that this will NOT look
for test rules, only local scores, whitelist_from(s), required_hits, and
auto_report_threshold.

Database Schema
---------------

The database must contain a table named "userpref" with at least three fields:
username varchar(8)	# this is the username whose e-mail is being filtered
preference varchar(30) 	# the preference (whitelist_from, required_hits, etc.)
value varchar(100)	# the value of the named preference

You can add as many other fields you wish as long as the above three fields are
contained in the table.

Included is a default table that can be safely used in your own setup.  To
use the default table, you must first create a database, and a username/password
that can access that database.  To install the table, use the following 
command:

mysql -p <password> -u <username> -p<password> databasename < spamassasin.sql

This will create the following table:

CREATE TABLE userpref (
  username varchar(8) default NOT NULL,
  preference varchar(30) default NOT NULL,
  value varchar(100) default NOT NULL,
  prefid int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  PRIMARY KEY (prefid)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

Once you have created the database and added the table, just add the required
lines to your global spamassassin.cf file.  Note that you must be running
spamc/spamd in order for this to work, and the current username must be passed
to spamd.  This can be done from spamc using the following .procmailrc recipe:

:0wf
| /usr/local/bin/spamc -u $LOGNAME

This has only been tested using MySQL as the RDMS, but it has been written
with the utmost simplicity using DBI, and any database driver that conforms
to the DBI interface should work without problems.

NB:  This should be considered BETA, and the interface, schema, or overall
operation of SQL support may change at any time with future releases of SA.
