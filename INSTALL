Important Note For Users Upgrading From Earlier Versions
--------------------------------------------------------

SpamAssassin no longer includes code to handle local mail delivery, as it
was not reliable enough, compared to procmail.  So now, if you relied on
spamassassin to write the mail into your mail folder, you'll have to
change your setup to use procmail as detailed below.

If you used spamassassin to filter your mail and then something else wrote
it into a folder for you, then you should be fine.

Support for versions of the optional Mail::Audit module before 1.9 is no
longer included.

The default mode of tagging (which used to be ***SPAM*** in the subject
line) no longer takes place.  Instead the message is rewritten.


Installing SpamAssassin
-----------------------

The easiest way to do this is using CPAN.pm, like so:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell                    [as root]
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Mail::SpamAssassin
	quit

On Debian, you can apt-get it from unstable, thanks to Duncan Findlay.

Alternatively download the tarfile, zipfile or Red Hat RPM from
http://spamassassin.org/ , and install that, like so:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd Mail-SpamAssassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL
	[option: add -DSPAMC_SSL to $CFLAGS to build an SSL-enabled spamc]
	make
	make install				[as root]

To install as non-root, do something like this:

	[unzip/untar the archive]
	cd Mail-SpamAssassin-*
	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/sausr SYSCONFDIR=~/saetc
	[option: add -DSPAMC_SSL to $CFLAGS to build an SSL-enabled spamc]
	make
	make install

If you are running AFS, you may also need to specify INSTALLSITELIB and
SITELIBEXP.

This will install the SpamAssassin modules and rules into the ~/sausr
and ~/saetc directories off your home directory.


SunOS Note
----------

Under SunOS, snprintf is not defined.  A library containing a SunOS version of
snprintf is included in contrib/snp.tar.gz, which is usable for building SA.
Mike Nolan <nolan AT naic dot edu> has built this, and here's his directions:

  I built SpamAssassin under SunOS 4.1.3.  (...)

  % cd contrib
  % gtar xzf snp.tar.gz
  % cd snp
  % gmake libsnp.a

  OK, now go to the spamassassin directory, and compile:

  % cd ..
  % gcc -g -O2 spamd/spamc.c spamd/libspamc.c spamd/utils.c \
          -o spamd/spamc -ldl -lnsl contrib/snp/libsnp.a -lm
  % gmake
  
  Now you have spamc and spamd.


Note for Perl 5.8 Users (incl Red Hat 8)
----------------------------------------

Perl 5.8 now uses Unicode internally by default, which causes trouble for
SpamAssassin (and almost all other reasonably complex pieces of perl
code!).

We've worked around this in most places, as far as we know, but there may
still be some issues.  In addition, there is a speed hit, which it would
be nice to avoid.

Setting the LANG environment variable before any invocation of
SpamAssassin sometimes seems to help fix it:

  export LANG=en_US

Notably, the LANG setting must not include "utf8".   However, some folks
have reported that this makes no difference.


Installing SpamAssassin for Personal Use (Not System-Wide)
----------------------------------------------------------

These steps assume the following, so substitute as necessary:
  - Your UNIX login is "user"
  - Your home directory is /home/user
  - The location of the procmail executable is /usr/bin/procmail

1. Uncompress and extract the SpamAssassin archive, using "unzip" or "tar
xvfz", in a temporary directory.

2. change directory into it:

	cd Mail-SpamAssassin-*

3. Make SpamAssassin as normal, but using your home directory as the
target:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/sausr SYSCONFDIR=~/saetc
	make
	make install

4. If you already use procmail, skip to step 6.  If not, ensure procmail
is installed using "which procmail" or install it from www.procmail.org.

5. Create a .forward file in your home directory containing the below
lines:

"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user"

6. Edit or create a .procmailrc file in your home directory containing the
below lines.  If you already have a .procmailrc file, add the lines to the
top of your .procmailrc file:

:0fw
| /home/user/sausr/bin/spamassassin

The above line filters all incoming mail through SpamAssassin and tags
probable spam with a unique header.  If you would prefer to have spam
blocked and saved to a file called "caughtspam" in your home directory,
instead of passed through and tagged, append this directly below the above
lines:

:0:
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
caughtspam

7. Now, you should be ready to send some test emails and ensure everything
works as expected.  First, send yourself a test email that doesn't contain
anything suspicious.  You should receive it normally, but there will be a
header containing "X-Spam-Status: No".  If you are only tagging your spam,
send yourself an obvious spam mail and check to be sure it is marked as
spam.  If your test emails don't get through to you, immediately rename
your .forward file until you figure out cause of the the problem, so you
don't lose incoming email.


Required Modules
----------------

These modules are required for spamassassin to build:

  - ExtUtils::MakeMaker >= 5.45 (from CPAN, or included in Perl 5.6 and
                                 higher)

    The ExtUtils::MakeMaker module is required in version 5.45 or later.
    Without the proper version the build will fail to create the Makefile.
    This is included in Perl versions 5.6 and later.


These modules are required for spamassassin to run:

  - File::Spec >= 0.8    (from CPAN, or included in Perl 5.6 and higher)

    The File::Spec module is required in version 0.8 (Mar 2000) or later.
    This is included in Perl versions 5.6 and later.

  - Pod::Usage           (from CPAN, or included in Perl 5.6 and higher)

    The Pod::Usage module is required.  This is included in Perl versions
    5.6 and later.

  - HTML::Parser >= 3.0  (from CPAN)

    HTML is used for an ever-increasing amount of email so this dependency
    is unavoidable.  Run "perldoc -q html" for additional information.

    If you use Debian, you can get HTML::Parser from the libhtml-parser-perl
    package.

Optional Additional Modules
---------------------------

In addition, the following modules will be used for some checks, if
available.  If they are not available, SpamAssassin will still work, just
not as effectively -- some of the spam-detection tests will have to be
skipped.


  - Net::DNS	(from CPAN)

    Used to check the RBL, RSS, DUL etc. and perform MX checks.
    Recommended.

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Net::DNS
	quit


  - Razor	http://razor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against Vipul's Razor collaborative
    filtering network.  Razor is not available from CPAN -- you have to
    download it from the URL above.

    Razor has a large number of dependencies on CPAN modules.  Feel free
    to skip installing it, if this makes you nervous; SpamAssassin will
    still work well without it.
    

  - DCC    http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/

    DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse) is a system similar to Razor.
    It supports fuzzy checksums and therefore detects some more spams than
    Razor does at the moment.

    To install it, download
    http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/source/dcc-dccproc.tar.Z and
    perform the following steps:

    # tar xfvz dcc-dccproc.tar.Z
    # cd dcc-dccproc-X.X.X
    # ./configure && make && make install
    # cdcc 'info'

    The last command will give some output. One line of it should contain
    something like:

        dcc.rhyolite.com,-         RTT+0 ms    anon

    Note that MIMEDefang users may need to set the 'dcc_path'
    configuration setting, since MIMEDefang does not set a PATH by
    default.


  - Pyzor    http://pyzor.sourceforge.net/

    Used to check message signatures against the Pyzor collaborative
    filtering network.  Pyzor was initially "a Python implementation of
    Razor", but now also uses its own (free) server architecture and is
    "based upon a new, lighter, more language-independent protocol."

    Pyzor requires at least Python 2.2.1 which can be found at
    http://www.python.org/ .
 
    To install Pyzor, download the latest revision from
    https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50000 and
    perform the following steps:

        # bunzip2 pyzor-*.tar.bz2
        # cd pyzor-*
        # python setup.py build
        # python setup.py install

    Note that your system might install the modules and scripts with
    non-world-readable permissions.  Correct this with a command such as:

	# chmod -R a+rX /usr/share/doc/pyzor \
		/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/pyzor \
		/usr/bin/pyzor /usr/bin/pyzord

    Read the INSTALL document if you want to setup your own Pyzor server and
    signature store.  Otherwise, you can just use the public servers.

    Note that MIMEDefang users may need to set the 'pyzor_path'
    configuration setting, since MIMEDefang does not set a PATH by
    default.


  - Mail::Audit, Mail::Internet, Net::SMTP	(from CPAN)

    If you want to use SpamAssassin with Mail::Audit, you will (obviously)
    require the Mail::Audit module, and any modules it requires (there's
    lots of them, unfortunately).
    
    Additionally, Mail::Internet is required if you wish to use the
    "-r/-w" options of the spamassassin program (reporting and replying,
    for spam-trap mail accounts).

    If you use procmail, KMail, 'spamassassin', or you plan to use
    'spamd', you will *not* need these.

    Here's how to install them using CPAN.pm:

	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	o conf prerequisites_policy ask
	install Mail::Audit
	quit

  - Digest::SHA1  (from CPAN)

    The Digest::SHA1 module will speed up some cryptographic hash tests,
    but is not required (although it may be required by another module).

    If you use Debian, you can get Digest::SHA1 from the libdigest-sha1-perl
    package.

  - Net::Ident   (from CPAN)

    If you plan to use the --auth-ident option to spamd, you will need
    to install this module.
